              G     reat heart and countless hours of effort have been invested into
                    this book. I am deeply indebted to the Zondervan team for their
              encouragement in spite of the many bumps and turns along the way. I
              would particularly like to thank Madison Trammel for his ever-­present
              support, Jesse Hillman for strategic perspectives, Brian Phipps for his
              longsuffering patience, and Stan Gundry for his vision in making this
              book a reality. Thanks is also due to Mark Sweeney for his insight, wis-
              dom, and loyal friendship.
                  I would also like to thank the many people who had a hand in
              making this book better: Richard Zetter, Richard Shumack, Matthew
              Thomas, John Njoroge, Shawn Hart, and Betsy Duncan. I must thank
              my darling bride, Michelle, for her loving encouragement despite the
              many days I had to spend away from her to write. I would also like to
              thank my beautiful daughter, Ayah, for being born in the middle of this
              project, filling my life with color and joy.
                  Last, and certainly not least, I would like to thank the Lord God for
              giving me the impetus and means to pour myself into this effort. I pray
              it would all be for his glory and his people. Amen.

                                           PREFACE


              D    ear Reader,
                        I truly thank you for taking the time to read this book. For me,
              and for millions of others like me, the subject matter of these pages is far
              more than information. It is the full engagement of heart and mind in
              search for the true God and true Life. What I share is a summary of fif-
              teen years of research that wrenched my heart and transformed my life.
                  You might have already read the account of my journey from Islam
              to Christianity, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus. That book is the heart of
              my story, detailing the relationships, emotions, and spiritual struggles
              in my search for God. No God but One: Allah or Jesus? is the mind of
              my story, examining the religions and their claims. In the course of this
              book, I hope to elucidate two overarching matters in particular: that
              the differences between Islam and Christianity have great implications,
              and that the evidence of history strongly supports the Christian claims.


              “GOD,” “ALLAH,” AND “YAHWEH”
              Before beginning, the title of this book could use some explanation.
              Both Islam and Christianity are monotheistic, believing there is “no
              God but one,” but they differ fundamentally on who that God is: Allah
              or Jesus.
                   There are at least four common uses of the Arabic word Allah.
              First and foremost, it is used to refer to the Muslim concept of God as
              described by Islam. This should not surprise anyone. The second use
              is to simply mean God in a generic sense; so, as with the English word
              God, Allah need not imply any specific religion. But the last two uses

                                                                                       13




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 13                                                 8/22/16 3:48 PM

           14   Preface

           may be surprising: Many Arabic-­speaking Christians do use Allah to
           mean the triune Christian God, and sometimes Christians use the term
           just to refer to the first person of the Trinity, the Father.
               To further complicate matters, Christians often do not clearly dis-
           tinguish between persons of the triune God. Thus they can confuse
           their Muslim friends by saying something like, “Jesus is God,” and in
           the next breath, “Jesus is the Son of God.” Although both statements are
           technically accurate doctrine, they will only cause confusion by switch-
           ing between uses of the word God. Their Muslim friends might respond
           to this by saying, “So is Jesus his own son?” And they would be right to
           ask for clarification.
               In this book, I will attempt to pay close attention to the way I use
           these words. The term Allah will refer specifically to the Muslim con-
           ception of God, the term Yahweh will be used when I intend to refer
           specifically to all three persons of the Trinity, and the term God will be
           used when the occasion calls for a generic use or intentional ambiguity.
           The terms Father, Son, and Spirit will be used to refer to the specific
           persons of the Trinity. Finally, if this paragraph is difficult to under-
           stand, I am really glad you are reading this book. Please spend extra
           time in part 2.


           THE CHALLENGE OF SEMANTICS
           One of the greatest troubles in religious discussions is how we define
           our words. When some people say “Islam,” they essentially mean the
           religion that a Muslim friend practices. But what a friend does can look
           very different from what an imam in Saudi Arabia does, so how do we
           decide which of them more accurately represents Islam? There are many
           branches and sects that purport to follow Islam, so how can we know
           whether they are actually Muslim? Do we just assume that everyone who
           identifies as a Muslim is representing Islam? If so, how do we handle the
           assertion that terrorist groups like ISIS do not represent Islam when they
           clearly claim to be Muslim?
               This problem is more difficult than it appears, but to prevent
           our terminology from becoming a moving target, we have to at least

                                                                             Preface   15

              circumscribe a definition. I think a religious group ought to be defined
              through a historical lens. What was it that gave the group its own iden-
              tity and set it apart from other groups at its inception, according to its
              traditional narratives? In the case of Muslims, their defining act was
              assenting that Muhammad is a prophet and exclusively following his
              teachings as revelations from Allah. In this book, we will consider all
              who do the same to be Muslims. We will consider Islam to be the teach-
              ings of Muhammad in that early period of identity formation.
                  Using the same reasoning, at their inception, Christians distin-
              guished their identity from their Greco-­Roman context by the belief
              in the God of the Hebrew Bible; yet they were distinct from other Jews
              because, on account of Christ’s resurrection, they believed Jesus himself
              to be the God of the Hebrew Bible, at least in some sense. Thus, those
              who hold to the monotheism of the Hebrew Bible while also following
              the divine, risen Jesus I consider to be Christians. Christianity would
              then be constituted by Jesus’ teachings as understood in that early
              period of identity formation.


              FINAL THOUGHTS AND CLOSING PRAYER
              This book has been a dream of mine for about a decade. I have met
              thousands of people who desperately seek God and are caught between
              the polemics of Islam and Christianity. I do not claim to be unbiased,
              but I have been on both sides of this debate, and I know how taxing it
              can be to try to wade through all the arguments. It is my prayer that this
              book will reach many who are in the throes of their search, and I pray
              it will lead them to the altar of the one true God. If that is you, know
              that I have prayed and shed tears for you, and that this book is written
              for you.
                  If you are reading this book mostly to learn and not out of a per-
              sonal struggle, please pause now and pray for those who are struggling
              between Islam and Christianity, striving to know God. Pray that he will
              meet them, and that he might equip you to be a part of their journey.
                  Now to Yahweh, the God of the Universe, who is able to do immeasura-
              bly more than all we can ask or imagine, I pray. I commit this book to You,

           16   Preface

           Lord, that You might be made known and glorified. I ask that You rescue
           lives and transform this world. May many come to a saving knowledge of
           You and a relationship that fills Your heart and theirs with joy. It is in the
           name of Jesus I pray. Amen.

                                 FATIMA’S DILEMMA


              R    epent! Otherwise you have blasphemed!”
                       Her brother had seethed with rage, his words still echoing
              in Fatima’s mind. Repent! You have blasphemed! They were laced with
              threat: The penalty for blasphemy was death. Had she really blas-
              phemed? She had not meant to. It had been a heated argument, and
              she accidentally blurted out some words . . . but what now? How could
              this have happened? She was struggling to think clearly. Her very life
              was in jeopardy.
                  Lifting her face from her hands, Fatima glanced at her computer.
              It was where she had confided her most private thoughts and inner
              struggles, where she could discuss new ideas and share opinions with
              compassionate ears. Her computer was her window to friends and
              freedom.
                  But today, it had betrayed her. As a result, she had been locked in her
              room for hours and feared for her life. Her brother could return at any
              moment, and unless she repented, it could be the end. She had to think.
              She had to think quickly and clearly.
                  Despite the treachery, her computer remained her only recourse. As
              she had done so many times before, she returned to her laptop to help
              her process. Logging onto an Arabic forum, she began a post.

           18   Prologue

           al-­Mutairi, a spirited young woman, a passionate teacher, a patriotic
           Saudi, and a recent convert to Christianity.
                Born in the province of Qasim, Fatima’s family came from a dis-
           tinguished Bedouin tribe and had raised her in accordance with their
           ancestral religion of Islam. Desiring a devout daughter, her mother had
           enrolled her in a Quran school at a young age, and Fatima began to
           take her Islamic faith very seriously. She started learning the Quran,
           scrupulously covering her hair with her hijab, and even fasting twice a
           week. She began to outstrip her family in religious zeal, avoiding tele-
           vision and secular music, and ultimately giving up friends on account
           of her fervor.
                Fatima’s mother grew concerned. She desired a faithful daughter,
           not a fanatical one. This was not the Islam that she knew. Regretting
           her decision, she took Fatima out of the Quran school and enrolled her
           in the state system.
                Over the ensuing years Fatima’s life normalized, yet she maintained
           a passion for her religion. She engaged in online debates with agnostics
           and apostates, defending her beloved prophet and religion from their
           attacks. In the course of these dialogues she investigated Islamic history
           and theology carefully, confident her faith would stand up to scrutiny.
           Yet during these debates she realized, amid anguish and despair, that she
           could no longer follow Islam. She stopped eating for several days, fell
           into depression, and became an atheist.
                But something told her this was not the answer. She began her
           search for God anew, this time calling out to him for help. It was then
           that she came across the Gospels, particularly the gospel of Matthew.
           It captivated her. She read it four times, being most moved by the
           Sermon on the Mount. After months of deliberation and investigation,
           she accepted its message. The Christian community with whom she
           connected advised her to keep her new faith a secret, as leaving Islam
           in Arabia incurs the penalty of death. This was difficult for Fatima,
           passionate and outspoken as she was, but she hid her conversion from
           all, keeping her private thoughts on her computer and conversing with
           her Christian community only online.
                It was to this online community that she now returned, in her

                                                                            Prologue    19

              moment of critical despair. After a brief thought, she titled her post and
              continued:

                       Title: I am in big trouble
                       Body: The peace of our Lord and our God and Jesus the
                               Messiah. I am in big trouble. My family has started to
                               doubt me because of a religious argument this evening
                               with my mother and brother . . .

                   Her brother. Fatima did not need to explain to the forum how dan-
              gerous an argument with him could be. Fatima’s brother had a similar
              start in the same family, but his story progressed very differently. His
              fervor for Islam had only grown since childhood, and he had become
              a fanatic. Ultimately he joined the “Commission for the Promotion
              of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice,” Saudi Arabia’s religious police,
              dedicated to enforcing a stringent version of Islam upon its citizens.
              Although many Muslims take issue with the Commission in specific
              and Saudi Arabia’s dogmatic version of Islam in general, the religious
              stringency attracts zealous young men like Fatima’s brother.
                   Fatima’s fingers flew across the keyboard, the words now pouring
              out of her as she recounted the harrowing events of the evening. She
              explained that, in a moment of weakness, she had complained about
              her lack of religious freedom in Islam. When her family pressed her
              to explain herself, she had blurted, “The way of the Messiah is purer
              than the way of the Messenger, and there is a great difference between
              them!” Her brother flew into a rage, threatening, “Repent! Otherwise
              you have blasphemed!” Even though Fatima tried to apologize, he broke
              into her room, took her computer, and started searching through her
              files. There he found Fatima’s journals, her Christian confessions, and
              even a picture of the cross.
                   His darkest suspicions were confirmed. A sharp malice flooded his
              eyes. He left her, giving her four hours to consider what she had done.
                   Repent! You have blasphemed!

           20   Prologue

               As she came to the end of her post, she made a simple request: “His
           glance frightened me. I do not trust him. Pray for me, please . . .”
               Four hours had passed. Her brother would return at any moment.
           She had to choose: Would she repent and embrace Islam, or would she
           stand firm in her Christian faith, potentially at the cost of her life?
           Which would it be, Islam or Christianity?


           ISLAM OR CHRISTIANITY?
           For Fatima, absolutely everything hinged on that question. No matter
           the strength of her convictions, when faced with the threat of death, she
           probably had a moment of considering how certain she really was: Is the
           way of the Messiah truly all that different from the way of the Messenger?
           Can we really be confident that one religion or the other is true? Even so, is
           the truth worth dying for?
               Every year, millions are faced with Fatima’s dilemma: to follow Islam
           or Christianity, to worship Allah or Jesus. Like Fatima, unless the seeker
           lives in a nominal or secular environment, the stakes are high: It can
           cost a seeker her family, her friends, her job, and potentially her life. For
           such seekers, it is not simply a matter of believing whatever seems right.
           They need to be sure, and they need to be sure it is worth the sacrifice.
               For me, it has been a decade since I decided to leave Islam, and the
           fallout of my decision haunts me every day. I knew it would, well before
           I ever converted, but I also knew that I was sure. I was sure that Islam
           and Christianity are not just two paths that lead to the same God, but
           two very different paths that lead very different ways. I was sure that
           I had excellent historical reason to believe the gospel. I was sure that,
           though I loved Islam, I could not ignore the problems that crippled its
           foundations.
               But most of all, I was sure that following the one true God would
           be worth all trials and all suffering. I had to follow the evidence and the
           truth, no matter the cost.
               I left my religion of twenty-­t wo years and became a follower of Jesus
           in 2005. In 2009, after graduating from medical school, I decided to
           leave medicine in order to share what I had learned about the gospel,

                                                                            Prologue   21

              the message of Christianity. I sincerely believe that this message has the
              power to transform hearts and change the world. The God it proclaims
              is unlike any other, and it is an unfathomable honor that we get to be a
              part of his story and introduce people to him.
                  While sharing this message, I often come across two kinds of people:
              Christians who enjoy criticizing Islam, and Muslims who want to argue
              but do not want to learn. I am not writing this book for either of them.
              I am writing for people who—­like Fatima and I did—­need the answers
              to these questions:

                  • What are the differences between Islam and Christianity?
                  • Can we be confident that Christianity or Islam is true?
                  • Is the truth worth dying for?

                  It took me four years to answer these questions, and they remain so
              important to me that I have studied them for another decade beyond.
              This book is my brief answer. After I share my findings, we will see
              how Fatima answered the same questions and discover the outcome of
              her story.

                     BETWEEN ISLAM AND
                        CHRISTIANITY?




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 23                     7/1/16 1:57 PM

           I  n August 2005, I came to the most painful realization of my life: I no
              longer believed Islam. I had no recourse left and could no longer delay
           the eventuality I had been fighting for years.
               As a child, I was raised to love Islam. I enjoyed memorizing chapters
           of the Quran and reciting them in my daily prayers. I looked forward to
           fasting every year with my family during Ramadan, thrilling in the early
           morning prayers and the communal suppers in the evening. I eagerly
           anticipated celebrating each Eid with my extended family. My entire life
           revolved around Islam, and I was proud of my Muslim heritage.
               Ironically, it was my confidence in Islam that brought my faith to
           the breaking point.
               Shortly after starting my undergraduate studies in 2001, I challenged
           a Christian friend at my university to consider the truth of Islam. Using
           reasoning that I had heard at mosques and from Muslim authorities, I
           argued that Islamic doctrines were verifiably true, whereas Christian
           doctrines were verifiably false. His responses led to research and investi-
           gation that ultimately spanned four years. What I discovered time and
           time again was that Christian doctrines held firm whenever they could
           be tested historically. The arguments against Christianity I had trusted
           my whole life were flawed and poor, and Christianity stood strong.
               But it was what happened next that shook my world and rattled
           me to the core. My friend used the same critical standards I had used
           against Christian doctrines to challenge Islam. Under the weight of this
           consistent scrutiny, the foundations of Islam crumbled.
               By the summer of 2005, I realized that I no longer believed the
           shahada, the Muslim proclamation that “there is no God but Allah, and
           Muhammad is his messenger.” Proclaiming the shahada is the minimal
           requirement of a Muslim, and I simply did not believe it. I desperately
           wanted to believe it, because everything I loved was found in Islam:

           24




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 24                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                    What Are the Differences between Islam and Christianity?   25

              my family, my friends, my culture, my traditions, my heritage. Leaving
              Islam meant sacrificing everything I knew and devastating the people
              I loved most.
                   At the same time, Christianity held no allure for me. My family were
              not Christians, I had just three Christian friends, my only experiences
              visiting churches had left a poor taste in my mouth, I thought Christmas
              and Easter were pagan traditions, and I really had no idea how I could
              fit in as a Christian. I did not want to believe in Christianity at all.
                   But I realized that it was too late: I already believed Christianity was
              true, and I could not be a Muslim because I could not honestly proclaim
              the shahada. The only question left was whether I would take the final
              step and move forward in faith. It is one thing to have found compelling
              evidence and quite another to act in faith on that evidence, especially
              when the cost is virtually unbearable.
                   On August 24, 2005, when I could resist no longer, I bent my knee
              to Jesus and proclaimed my faith in him. Soon after, my family was
              shattered, and the next year of my life was by far the most harrowing I
              have ever endured. I was now an outsider, both to my family and to all
              my friends in the Islamic community. It was just weeks before I received
              my first death threat. Ten years later, I still get the occasional death
              threat, I never regained my old friends, and my family has never been
              the same. I feel the painful fallout of my decision every day.
                   So when I hear people say that Islam and Christianity are basically
              the same, I have to try to restrain my incredulous response. Are Islam
              and Christianity the same? My parents certainly do not think so, nor do
              any of the dozens of friends I lost. This cliché is a slap in the face to the
              hundreds of thousands of converts who have left Islam for Christianity
              and vice versa.
                   Not only are these religions different, but the differences have far
              greater ramifications than I realized when I converted. I knew that the
              historical doctrines of the two religions were different, but doctrines do
              not exist in a vacuum. They work together to impact the way we see the
              world, which in turn changes who we are.
                   For example, the Muslim conception of God, whom we will call
              Allah, has different characteristics from the Christian conception of

           26   What Are the Differences between Islam and Christianity?

           God. Of course, the most obvious is that Allah is not triune, whereas the
           one Christian God subsists in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the
           Holy Spirit. The concept of God’s personhood is so disparate between
           Islam and Christianity that the basic Christian axiom “Jesus is God”
           registers as blasphemy to the average Muslim. Although both religions
           teach that there is no God but one, merely beginning to consider God’s
           personhood demonstrates that they disagree significantly about what
           he is like.
               And what we think God is like has a tremendous impact on how
           we see the world he created. Why did God create humans: to share inti-
           macy with them or to test them? What does he think about people: are
           they his servants or his children? How does he want us to live: focusing
           on love or focusing on law? What does he tell us about the afterlife: to
           anxiously anticipate unknown judgment or to have joyful faith in his
           grace? The Islamic view of God and the Christian view lend themselves
           to different answers, and how we answer these questions changes how
           we see ourselves, other people, and the world around us.
               Both Muslims and Christians believe that there is no God but one,
           but is he Allah or is he Jesus? I can tell you from personal experience and
           in all sincerity: How we answer this question has the power to change
           who we are.

                                             Chapter 1



                                   THE WAY TO LIFE


              A     s a young college student, I was proud to be a voice for Islam in the
                    great chorus of religious perspectives at my university. The diversity of
              thought was beautiful because it existed in an environment where critical
              thinking was encouraged. As we presented our ideas and views, others
              were free both to challenge our perspectives and to gain insights from
              them, and we were all sharpened by the critical engagement. Tolerance
              meant always accepting people, without always accepting their ideas.
                  So it was that in the midst of challenging a colleague’s most dearly
              held beliefs that we became best friends. David Wood was on the debate
              and forensics team with me at Old Dominion University, and when
              I saw him reading a Bible, I did not hesitate to question its reliability
              and preservation. Due to our mutual passion for God and truth, we
              connected instantly, even though our views strongly clashed. We found
              ourselves in such constant disagreement over fundamental matters that
              we often signed up for classes together just so we could sit in the back of
              the lecture halls and argue.
                  But when the circle was broadened and other viewpoints were
              brought into the discussion, there was a surprising trend that emerged.
              The first time it happened was when an agnostic teammate named Marie
              overheard one of our arguments and joined the discussion. David and I
              found ourselves side by side, in agreement with one another against her
              views. The second time it happened was when a Buddhist friend named
              Zach presented his grounds for being Buddhist, and David and I both
              disagreed with him for the same reasons. Whenever we engaged people
              from other worldviews, the discussions highlighted the similarities
              between Islam and Christianity.

                                                                                          29

           30   Sharia or the Gospel?

                There’s really no question that Islam and Christianity are close to
           one another on the broader religious spectrum. They are both mono-
           theistic, the largest two faith communities in the world, and they share
           many similarities. Each teaches the doctrine of an eternal, all-­powerful,
           all-­k nowing God who is sovereign over the universe. It is God who
           created mankind out of one man and one woman, yet mankind turns
           away from him. Each teaches that one day there will be a resurrection
           and final judgment. Before then, it is of paramount importance for us
           to seek God and follow him.
                But the similarities between Islam and Christianity run even deeper,
           beyond the trappings of monotheism: Both lay claim to Abrahamic
           lineage; both teach that God has sent messengers, human and angelic,
           to steer people back to him; both teach that God has inspired divine
           scriptures to guide man; both teach that Satan is a deceiver that misleads
           the unwary; and both teach that believers ought to sacrificially care for
           each other and proclaim the truth to nonbelievers.
                Perhaps the most surprising shared feature is reverence for Jesus.
           Both Islam and Christianity teach that Jesus was born of a virgin and
           that he was the most miraculous man who ever lived. Both the Bible and
           the Quran teach that Jesus cleansed lepers, healed the blind, and even
           raised the dead. Indeed, both books teach that Jesus is the Messiah, and
           Muslims await his return, as do Christians.
                So there’s no question that there is much in common between Islam
           and Christianity. It would be biased to ignore this, especially consid-
           ering that the gamut of worldviews runs from atheist to pantheist, as
           David and I witnessed at our university.


           THE WAY TO LIFE: A LAW OR A PERSON?
           But the many similarities do not mean that the differences are not sig-
           nificant. Humans and chimpanzees share 95 percent of their DNA, but
           the remaining 5 percent is incredibly important! So it is with Islam and
           Christianity. There is much shared DNA, but the two are phenotypi-
           cally quite different.
               Where the difference matters most is in the ultimate message of each




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 30                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                        The Way to Life   31

              religion. According to Islam, the way to paradise is sharia, a code of
              laws to follow that will please Allah and earn his favor. Sharia is literally
              translated “the way.” According to the Christian message, the gospel,
              the way to eternal life is Jesus. He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and
              the Life; no one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6). In
              Islam, sharia is the way, and in Christianity, Jesus is the way.
                  How is it that the way to life in one religion is a law, whereas in the
              other faith it is a person? To understand, we have to compare sharia and
              the gospel.

                                           Chapter 2



                             COMPARING SHARIA
                              AND THE GOSPEL

           THE ISLAMIC WORLDVIEW
           The word Islam means “submission,” and the plain message of Islam
           is exactly that: Humans should all submit to the sovereign will of
           God. Allah, having predestined the universe, made mankind with the
           express purpose of worshiping him (Quran 51.56). To guide humanity,
           Allah sent prophets to all people to lead them out of ignorance (Quran
           4.163–165).
               It is important to note here that the concept of prophet in Islam does
           not mean the same thing that it does in the Bible. Prophets in Islam
           have a higher status than all other people, being men chosen by God to
           lead mankind. The Quran uses the term to mean a divinely appointed
           leader, not necessarily one who prophesies.
               Adam is considered the first prophet, but also mentioned in the
           Quran are Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Job, Moses, Jonah,
           Aaron, Solomon, David, and of course, Jesus (e.g., Quran 4.163). Since
           these people all submitted to Allah, they practiced submission (i.e.,
           Islam). Thus they are considered people who submit (i.e., Muslims). All
           who followed these prophets in submitting to Allah are also considered
           Muslims, even if they were born ages before Muhammad.
               Allah revealed his guidance to each prophet as the people needed it
           and as they could bear it. For example, Moses’ people needed to rebel
           against the Pharaoh, so Allah revealed “eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.”
           But Jesus’ people needed to be peaceful, so Allah taught them to “turn
           the other cheek.” Both Moses and Jesus, as well as other prophets, were

           32




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 32                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                      Comparing Sharia and the Gospel   33

              given divine scripture. Angels dictated Allah’s revelation to them, and
              the revelation was written down as Torah, Injil (gospel), and other books
              (e.g., Quran 5.46).
                  Tragically, people did not faithfully follow the prophets that Allah
              sent to them. So in his mercy, Allah sent Muhammad and gave him the
              Quran. Thus, Allah gave mankind the final, perfected religion (Quran
              5.3). Islam is therefore the culmination of Judaism, Christianity, and all
              other world religions, which started off in line with Islamic teaching. All
              people still following these religions after the arrival of Muhammad are
              either misled or rebellious, and no religion will be accepted from them
              on the day of judgment except Islam (Quran 3.81–85).
                  It is there, at the day of judgment, that one finds the major impetus
              to follow Islam. The Quran emphasizes that on that day, all people will
              be held accountable to Allah for their sins (Quran 6:164; 17:15; 35:18;
              39:7; 53:38). This is an understanding firmly entrenched in the Muslim
              psyche: Though God may be merciful and absolve us of our sins, no
              one else can intercede. Muslims must live as good a life as they can
              to approach heaven, and hope for God’s merciful judgment to secure
              their salvation.


              THE ISLAMIC SOLUTION: SHARIA
              However, Islam teaches that the fundamental problem of mankind is
              ignorance, that man needs to be guided in order to live good lives. Once
              people learn what to believe, aqeeda, and how to live, sharia, they will
              earn the pleasure of Allah.
                  In regards to right belief, the emphasis is on the Islamic conception
              of monotheism: Allah is not a Father, and Allah is not a Son (Quran
              112). He is an absolute unity, a monad. The other basic components
              of aqeeda have already been mentioned above: belief in the prophets,
              belief in divinely inspired books, belief in angels and the unseen, belief
              in the day of judgment, and belief in Allah’s predestining sovereignty.
              Together, these are called the Six Articles of Faith. There is much, much
              more to Islamic belief, but this is the core.
                  Right practice in Islam is learned through Islamic Law, called




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 33                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           34   Sharia or the Gospel?

           sharia, which is understood as “the way to water.” Especially for a desert
           people, the concept is powerful: Following sharia is the way to life itself.
           Sharia dictates virtually every aspect of a devout Muslim’s life, from
           what foods to eat, to proper forms of currency, to exact words to recite
           during prayers. Of all Islamic practices, five are paramount: proclaim-
           ing the Islamic motto, the shahada: “There is no God but Allah, and
           Muhammad is his Messenger”; praying the five daily prayers; fasting
           during the month of Ramadan; giving alms; and undertaking a pilgrim-
           age to Mecca. Together, these are called the Five Pillars of Islam.
               Both aqeeda and sharia are ultimately grounded in the life and
           teachings of Muhammad. He is the embodiment of Islam, and this is
           why Muslims are expected to follow him as the perfect exemplar. His
           actions and his sayings in life are recorded in a vast body of literature,
           collectively called hadith literature. So important are the hadith that,
           after the Quran, they form the second rung of sharia.
               Given the breadth of teachings in the Quran and the incredibly wide
           scope of hadith literature, discerning sharia is a task for the learned.
           Muslim jurists study the vast traditions and legal precedents before
           making official judgments, called fatawa (plural of fatwa). These men
           are technically called fuqaha, but they are often included under the
           umbrella term for a Muslim leader, imam. Collectively, the consensus
           of these scholars is called ijma and is understood to be the third major
           component of sharia.
               Finally, we are at a place to understand the message of Islam. Sharia
           is more than just Islamic law. It is the answer to mankind’s ignorance
           and, if followed, will result in a life of peace with Allah and an abun-
           dance of his blessings. Sharia is derived from the Quran, exemplified
           in Muhammad’s life, and explained by imams. On the last day, if we
           have obeyed and done well, Allah may grant us mercy and allow us into
           heaven where we will have an eternal reward.
               So in sum, when it comes to salvation in Islam, sharia is literally “the
           way,” and submission to God’s will is our primary expression of worship.

              THE CHRISTIAN WORLDVIEW
              In the beginning of the Christian worldview is the one God, Yahweh.
              He exists as three persons who love each other perfectly. Thus, the one
              God is love in his very essence. Out of this love, God created mankind
              in his image, that God might love man and man might love God.
                  It is important to note that this concept of love is often misun-
              derstood by Muslims due to the various ways the word love is used in
              English. The specific concept of love we are discussing is often called
              agape love. It is not the kind of love we envision in a romantic relation-
              ship; it does not imply much emotion at all. The Bible gives a beautiful
              description of this love in 1 Corinthians 13, but it is essentially this: a
              selflessness that delights in others. That is who God is, almighty yet
              most humble, the center of the universe yet selfless. He created mankind
              so he could delight in us, and we in him, with selfless love.
                  But in order for this love to be valuable, it must be voluntary, so God
              gave man the choice to love him or reject him. When man disobeys
              God, it is tantamount to rejecting God. In rejecting the Source of Life,
              we bring death upon ourselves. This bears repeating: The result of sin is
              death because it is a rejection of the Source of Life.
                  That’s why, in the Christian worldview, sin against God is more
              than just doing something wrong. It is rebellion against the Sustainer of
              the universe. It is the most destructive force in the cosmos, the ultimate
              root of every pained heart, every broken family, every pointless war,
              every heinous genocide. Sin spreads through generations like a malig-
              nant cancer, and it razes civilizations like a plague. The effect of sin is
              cataclysmic. Like taking a sledgehammer to a mirror, sin shatters the
              image in which man is made. When Adam sinned, the image of God in
              man was irreparably broken.
                  This is the Christian worldview: Sin has ravaged our souls and the
              entire world. There is no way for us to un-­sin. We cannot simply do a
              few good deeds to unshatter our souls. There is nothing on earth that
              we can do. It would take a miracle, an act of God, to restore us and save
              this world.

           36   Sharia or the Gospel?


           THE CHRISTIAN SOLUTION: THE GOSPEL
           But in the Christian message, there is good news. In Greek, the word
           for good news is euangelion, which in English is translated “gospel.” And
           the good news is this: Even though we cannot get to God, out of his
           great love, God has come to us and made a way for us. God himself has
           paid for our sins and will eternally restore our souls. All we have to do is
           repent of our rebellion, have faith in what he has done, and follow him.
                To pay for our sins, God—­specifically the second person of the
           Trinity—­entered into the world. Without changing his divine nature,
           God took upon himself a human nature. He was born as a human, but
           not of the broken lineage of Adam. He was born unbroken, the way
           mankind was intended to be, the way we will ultimately be when we
           are miraculously remade. He took the name Jesus, which means “God
           saves.” With respect to his human nature he grew as a human, ate food
           as a human, suffered alongside humans, and ultimately died as a human.
           In all this he never sinned, so he was able to bear our sins. He lived the
           life we ought to have lived so he could die the death that we deserve to
           die. By dying on our behalf he took upon himself the sins of the world,
           so that whoever believes in him and accepts what he has done will have
           eternal life.
                From the perspective of a human watching Jesus, it might have
           looked like just another man dying just another death. So to prove to
           the world that his death was not just another death but one that brings
           life to the world, and to prove that he was indeed the God he claimed to
           be, he rose from the dead. On the one hand, this was a sign to all who
           were skeptical that Jesus truly has supernatural authority and deserves
           to be heard. On the other hand, it was a symbol for those who believe in
           him that death has been defeated. Jesus has conquered it for us.
                Those of us who wish to accept God’s sacrifice on our behalf must
           repent of our sins and yield ourselves to following him. As we do, God—­
           specifically the third person of the Trinity—­makes our hearts into a
           holy temple and lives within us. He transforms us from the inside out.
           In other words, as we follow Jesus we become more like him, the unbro-
           ken man, and the Holy Spirit gradually begins the miraculous work

              of restoring our otherwise irreparable souls. Like Jesus, we are filled
              with a selfless love, and we begin to live for others instead of ourselves,
              just as God lived for us. Those who go further along the path of being
              like Jesus even reflect him in their willingness to die for others, just as
              Jesus was willing to die for us. They become more like God: selflessly
              delighting in others.
                  Finally we are at a place to understand the message of Christianity:
              The fundamental problem of mankind is sin, and we are powerless to
              save ourselves. The good news is that God loves us and makes a way for
              us by paying our penalty himself upon the cross. Jesus proved that he is
              the Author of Life by rising from death. We who repent and follow Jesus
              demonstrate our faith in him and his salvation, and God begins a trans-
              forming work in us. As we follow Jesus the Holy Spirit makes us more
              like him and sends us into the world to love mankind with the selfless
              love of God. We can even lay down our lives for others, as Jesus modeled
              for us. Our ultimate restoration will come to miraculous fruition when
              we are remade, unbroken, to live with him and love him for eternity.
                  So when it comes to salvation in Christianity, Jesus is literally “the
              way,” and our love for God is our primary expression of worship.

                           QUESTIONING GRACE


           I  n 2013, I was given the honor of joining Ravi Zacharias International
              Ministries, a global team of Christian thinkers and evangelists. One
           of my first engagements was in Hong Kong with a charismatic Egyptian
           Muslim who had originally traveled east to pursue his dream of becom-
           ing a celebrity musician, but who ultimately became disenchanted with
           the music industry and found his peace in Islam. Since then, he had
           become a da’ee, a Muslim dedicated to preaching Islam.
               He was very warm and hospitable, and even though our debate was
           impassioned, it had an encouraging and constructive tone. We embraced
           one another at the end of the dialogue and encouraged the audience to
           ask us questions before leaving. Soon after, two children approached
           me, a girl and a boy about twelve and ten years old, apparently sent by
           their mother. When they asked me their question, I could not help but
           smile, because I remembered asking the same question of Christians
           when I was their age, also urged on by my parents: “If God just forgives
           all Christians and none of them go to hell, why would any Christian do
           good when they can sin all they want?”
               Now that we have considered the differences between the Islamic
           message and the Christian message, this question should be no surprise.
           In Islam, the reward for following sharia is heaven, and the deterrent
           for disobedience is hell. Why would anyone make the hard moral deci-
           sions if they were promised the reward regardless? Since the solution to
           man’s problem in Islam is a law, the gospel’s idea of a heart transformed
           by God is foreign to many Muslims—­as it was to these children. The
           disjuncture between sharia and the gospel also leads to other common
           questions that Muslims ask Christians.

           38

                                                                    Questioning Grace   39


              THE DOCTRINE OF ORIGINAL SIN
              Since Islam teaches that every person must bear their own sin, Muslims
              often question the doctrine of original sin: How does Adam have any-
              thing to do with our standing before God?
                  Thankfully there is a bridge of understanding between Muslims and
              Christians here, as Muslims do believe that Adam was cast out of the
              garden when he sinned. Also, it is helpful to note that there are different
              views of original sin in Christian thought. The view that I found most
              helpful when I was still a Muslim points out that, when the dust settles,
              Muslims and Christians do not disagree on much here.
                  According to this view, the Bible teaches that no man is responsible
              for the sin of his father (Deut. 24:16; Ezek. 18:20), which means that
              people are not guilty of Adam’s sin itself. When we are judged, we will
              be judged for our sins alone, but Adam’s sin is where it all started.
                  Remembering the Christian view of the destructiveness of sin, when
              Adam sinned, it was as if his soul was pulverized. Even though Adam
              was created in the image of God, it was the shattered, irreparably dis-
              torted image of God that Adam’s progeny inherited (Gen. 5:3). Since
              mankind inherited the broken image from Adam, all humans are bro-
              ken and prone to sin. They are not judged for his sin, but because of his
              sin, we, his progeny, have all been born broken. Because of his sin, we
              all ultimately sin.
                  No matter our view of original sin, though, Christians believe that
              everybody does sin, and their own sin is enough to bring God’s judg-
              ment upon them. With this, Muslims usually agree.


              THE JUSTICE OF GOD: DEATH FOR THE SMALLEST
              SIN YET MERCY FOR THE GREATEST SINNER?
              According to the basic principles of Islam, Allah will weigh good deeds
              against bad deeds when he judges us. In broad strokes, Muslims believe
              that someone who has sinned very little has little to worry about. For
              this reason they often ask why God would demand justice for even the
              smallest sin. As the da’ee in Hong Kong pointedly asked me during




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 39                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           40   Sharia or the Gospel?

           our debate, “Would it be just for a judge to sentence you to execution
           for jaywalking?”
               This was a fair question, and when I was a Muslim asking the same
           question, I found that Christians often did not give satisfactory answers.
           Usually, they would point me to Romans 6:23, which teaches that “the
           wages of sin is death.” My response would always be honest: “That’s
           another reason not to trust the Bible. It does not make sense. Why give
           the death penalty for even the smallest of sin?” I was not surprised when
           the da’ee made the same challenge during our debate.
               Nor was I surprised when he asked the corollary question: “How
           can God be just if he is willing to forgive serial killers and genocidal
           dictators? You’re telling me Hitler could have gone to heaven if he had
           become a Christian?” It is an emotionally charged question, but one that
           deserves a thorough answer.
               To fully understand, we need to remember two things: the nature of
           sin and the nature of God.
               Remember that, according to Christian teaching, sin is not just
           doing something wrong. It is a rebellion against God, the Source of
           Life. Death is not a punishment for our actions as much as it is a con-
           sequence. God does not execute us for jaywalking; we get run over by a
           truck while jaywalking.
               Regarding the nature of God, we need to remember that he loves us
           absolutely. Just as a perfect father would love his child no matter what
           the child does, so our heavenly Father loves us no matter what we have
           done. As an example, a father would love his son even if he were a thief.
           He might even turn his son over to the authorities to face the conse-
           quences of his crime, but it would be out of love and desire for ultimate
           rehabilitation. In the same way, God loves his children despite their sins,
           though he does allow them to endure the consequences of their actions
           on earth so that they might repent and change their ways. In all this he
           always loves us, because he is our perfect Father, and he is love.
               But there are at least two sides to such love, and they often mani-
           fest at apparent odds with one another: mercy and justice. A father can
           love his criminal child by being merciful, but a father must also love
           his victimized child by demanding justice. Both mercy and justice are




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 40                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                    Questioning Grace   41

              expressions of God’s absolute love. This poses a dilemma: Where does
              God draw the line between the two? If he demands justice, where is the
              mercy for the criminal? If he offers mercy, where is the justice for the
              victim? He cannot draw that line arbitrarily because he is God. So where
              does God draw the line?
                  Magnifying this dilemma, God is also absolute. To illustrate, it is
              helpful to imagine a human judge that demands justice for every crime,
              never forgiving any. Though not merciful at all, he would be a very
              just judge. Now if God did not punish all sins, he would be less just
              than that human judge. Can we really believe that God’s sense of justice
              could be potentially less than that of a human? Of course not. Similarly,
              if we can imagine a human judge that forgives every crime, he would be
              a very merciful judge, though not just at all. If God did not forgive every
              sin, he would be less merciful than that human judge. But God is the
              most merciful; his mercy cannot be outdone by a human.
                  What is the way out of this dilemma? Where does God draw the line
              between mercy and justice?
                  Herein lies the genius and infinitude of the love of God: He does not
              draw the line. He offers mercy to everyone who has ever sinned while
              also demanding justice for every sin ever committed. He does this by
              offering to bear the consequence of our sins himself. The consequence of
              our sins is death, and God is willing to die on behalf of all his children.


              HOW CAN JESUS DIE FOR THE SINS OF MANKIND?
              This is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions in Muslim-­
              Christian dialogue, and it is important to recall the Muslim impetus for
              the question: Islam emphasizes that each person will be responsible for
              their own sins. No human can intercede for another.
                  But here is another example where agreement is close at hand:
              Christians also believe, as Muslims do, that no mere human is in
              the position to bear another’s sins. In order to come to that realiza-
              tion, though, I had to remember that Christians believe Jesus is God.
              Muslims believe that God is able to forgive sins, and that is exactly
              what Christians teach through the gospel: that God is the one forgiving




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 41                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           42   Sharia or the Gospel?

           the sins of mankind. His death on the cross is his reified act of mercy
           upon our sins. Instead of just forgiving us on the day of judgment in the
           distant future, he has paid for our sins at a very real point in time and
           space: in the first century, on the cross.
                Another question follows closely: “Is it just for God to transfer sins?
           No one is able to bear the burdens of another, because that would be
           unfair.” Here, it is helpful to note two things. First, people voluntarily
           bear the burdens of others all the time, and it is completely just. For
           example, when young adults want to obtain a loan from a bank but do
           not have any credit, they have to find a cosigner, usually a mother or
           father, to vouch for them. If they then fail to pay the loan, the burden
           falls on the parent who vouched for them.
                In the same way, the gospel teaches that God, a good and loving
           Father, has vouched for us. When we stand guilty in judgment, our debt
           will be imputed to God, who has paid it.
                Something else that is helpful to point out, though, is that the
           Quran actually does not teach that no one can bear the sins of another.
           Looking carefully at the relevant Quranic verses, all five of them teach
           that “no bearer of burdens can bear the burdens of another.” It is not
           that no person can bear the sins of another, but that anyone who is
           already a sinner is in no place to bear the sins of others. Since Muslims
           believe that Jesus did not bear any sins, theoretically Islamic theology
           should be compatible with Jesus bearing the burdens of others.


           WHAT REASON DO CHRISTIANS HAVE TO DO GOOD?
           When the young siblings in Hong Kong asked me their question, I
           briefly considered the ways I could answer. Sitting down next to them, I
           nodded toward their mother and asked them a question in return: “Do
           you love your mom?”
               Slightly taken aback, they answered emphatically, “Of course!”
               Smiling, I asked them a simple question: “When she asks you to do
           something, like clean your room, what do you think would make her
           happier: if you cleaned your room because you love her, or if you cleaned
           your room because you were afraid she would punish you?”




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 42                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                  Questioning Grace   43

                  Without hesitation, the sister answered, “Because we love her.”
              And as the words left her lips, the realization was apparent on her face:
              obedience under the shadow of threat is hardly obedience at all, but
              compulsion. Christian obedience, devoid of threat and rooted in love, is
              what God truly wants.
                  I began to explain to her and her brother that when we respond to
              the gospel and live as children of God, our Father changes our hearts
              and makes us want to obey out of love. For the next few minutes they
              continued asking me questions in earnest, clearly unfinished when their
              mother whisked them away.

                DIAGNOSIS AND DELIVERANCE


           I  n the spring of 2009, as I was graduating from medical school,
              I undertook a project working as a volunteer with a humanitarian
           organization called Physicians for Peace. They were doing excellent work
           around the globe, and the project that I chose to help with was geared
           toward educating young mothers in the barrios of Santo Domingo.
               The Rio Ozama runs through the Dominican capital city, and its
           low-­lying banks are home to thousands of metal shanties. Every year the
           rains cause the Ozama to swell into the crudely constructed shacks, and
           for weeks the occupants flee until the floodwaters recede, only to return
           to disease-­infested homes. At the time, newborn mortality rates were
           high as young mothers often could not afford quality healthcare and
           were forced to watch their babies die. Physicians for Peace stepped in to
           equip key women in these barrios, whom we called resource mothers, to
           educate mothers of newborns on disease prevention and hygiene. Thanks
           to their work, newborn morbidity and mortality rates fell dramatically.
               When I came on board, I found that the young mothers were facing
           an insidious disease that had not been diagnosed: depression. In their
           cultural circles, depression bore the stigma of being an imagined disease
           of unstable women. For my project, I trained the resource mothers to
           detect major depression and postpartum depression in the young moth-
           ers they were educating. Many of the resource mothers, especially those
           who were suffering with depression themselves, were surprised to hear
           that it was a real disease. They had always been told that depression was
           just in their heads and that they simply needed to “cheer up”; but no
           matter how hard they tried, the depression was real.

              rowing if not diagnosed. These women had tried everything, but they
              never found relief because they did not know the real problem. When
              I finally spoke to them about the reality of depression, many of them
              broke down in tears, relieved to hear that their disease was real and that
              there was help for them.
                  I share this story because I believe the spiritual realm has this in
              common with the physical: If we misdiagnose what ails us, the treat-
              ment will not work, and we will continue to suffer. Islam diagnoses
              the world with ignorance and offers the remedy of sharia, a law to
              follow. Christianity diagnoses the world with brokenness and offers
              the remedy of God himself, a relationship with him that leads to heart
              transformation.
                  What is it that truly ails mankind, and is there a cure?
                  From my perspective, the gospel resonates with reality: People are
              broken in their hearts and souls, and no matter how educated or self-­
              reflective we become, it does not appear that following rules will be
              enough to address the problem. The problem of mankind is deeper than
              what we do; it is embedded in who we are. Having spent some time
              working with the dejected and downtrodden, such as those whose lives
              have been ravaged by various addictions, I do not think ignorance is
              their problem. It is brokenness. Having seen families torn apart by abuse
              or anger, I know the answer appears to lie not in knowledge or following
              rules but in transformed hearts.
                  This leads me to a second observation: Mankind seems incapable of
              saving itself. In our natural selves, we perpetuate cycles of destruction.
              Our hearts are broken, so we break other hearts. We were abused, so
              we abuse in return. Our families were fractured, so we leave fractured
              families in our wake. When loved ones are killed, we kill in revenge.
              This is the way of humanity, and we need an otherworldly solution—­
              something radical to break these cycles. We need God to save us.
                  The gospel is that radical solution. It teaches us that God gives us
              that otherworldly grace, forgiving us no matter what our sins. His love is
              extravagant: “Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither
              the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor
              anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of

           46   Sharia or the Gospel?

           God” (Rom. 8:38–39 NIV). He loves us, and we are forgiven. Our souls
           can rest in our loving Father and his all-­embracing grace.
                When we realize the depravity of our sins and the depths of our
           rebellion against God, it exceeds the mind’s capacity to grasp this grace.
           What could we do to deserve such forgiveness? Nothing at all! He
           engulfs us with his infinite love and absolute mercy, though we cannot
           earn it.
                It is into that overwhelming flood of grace that our hearts release
           their poison. When we have been forgiven so much, how can we hold
           our fellow man accountable for so little? In his love, our hearts are made
           new. We no longer begrudge, no longer desire revenge. Renewed by the
           restoration he has brought about in us, we desire to uplift the abused
           and restore the broken. He transforms our hearts, and we in turn are
           driven to transform the world around us.
                And that leads me to my final point: The gospel is all about God and
           what God has done. God introduces life into the world, and when we
           rebel, God saves us. When we sin against God, God pays for our sins.
           When we sin against one another, God gives the grace of restoration.
           This message is all about him, not at all about what we can do or have
           earned for ourselves.
                Not only does this free us from the anxiety of having to save our-
           selves, but it also frees us from the pride that comes with successfully
           following rules and assuming that we have won our own salvation.
           Being so unburdened by anxiety and pride, we are free to live for others.
                So the gospel accurately diagnoses the problem of humanity, which
           is our own brokenness. Through his otherworldly, heavenly grace, he
           transforms us and frees us from our cycles of destruction. Through it
           all, he is at the center, disentangling us from pride and anxiety, helping
           us focus on others and not on ourselves. The gospel is not just an answer
           that works; it is the only answer that will work.

                       THE ISLAMIC INQUISITION


              A     lthough many challenge the notion that Islam was spread by the
                    sword, there is no question that the sword featured prominently in
              Islam’s early history. It was with the sword that Muslim armies swept
              North Africa and conquered Persia in the years immediately after
              Muhammad’s death. The caliphs, Muhammad’s successors, were soon
              after beset with high-­profile assassinations: Umar, the second caliph of
              Islam, was slain by avenging Persians; Uthman, the third caliph of Islam,
              was besieged and then slaughtered by Muslim rebels; Muhammad’s
              cousin Ali, the fourth caliph, was also assassinated by dissidents, but
              not before he had marched against the army of Aisha, Muhammad’s
              young bride. That was the first Islamic civil war, often called the First
              Fitna, and on that day ten thousand Muslims killed one another on the
              field of battle. With the spilling of their blood were sown the first seeds
              of Shia and Sunni discord. The sword was ever unsheathed in these
              earliest years of Islam.
                  Following the age of the Companions of Muhammad, the Umayyad
              Caliphate governed the Islamic empire for a short ninety years until,
              through revolt and open war, the Abbasid Muslims took control and
              established a dynasty that lasted for 750 years. The reign of the seventh
              Abbasid caliph is fascinating, for it was he who imposed the Mihna, the
              Islamic Inquisition.
                  Al-­Mamun became caliph in AD 813, after a struggle for power
              that ended in the beheading of the previous caliph, his brother. From
              the start, al-­Mamun’s rule was tumultuous, his allies few. Although
              he never embraced Shiism himself, he began ingratiating himself with
              the Shia. In AD 827, al-­Mamun officially declared that Muhammad’s

                                                                                      49




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 49                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           50   Tawhid or the Trinity?

           cousin Ali, the paragon of the Shia and their first imam, was the best
           of all Muhammad’s Companions. Even more striking than the move
           toward Shia sympathies was his alignment with Shia rationalism: He
           declared the Quran to be a created book.
               This was a colossal proclamation, and to understand its immensity
           we have to consider the contemporary theological controversies in Islam.
           In those days, debates about the Quran raged among Muslim theologi-
           ans over the doctrine of tawhid. Tawhid teaches that Allah is absolutely
           one; and the conclusion naturally arose among some thinkers that since
           Allah is absolutely one, he cannot have attributes. Attributes would curb
           his absolute unity, being things he has as opposed to things he is.
               This conclusion of Islamic philosophy can use a little exploration.
           If God has attributes, he must always have had them, because he is
           unchanging. That would make those attributes eternal. If those eternal
           attributes are not a part of his essence, part of who he is, then something
           other than God existed alongside God from the beginning of time. The
           existence of eternal entities apart from Allah’s essence was an affront to
           Muslim theologians committed to tawhid, the absolute unity of God.
               Where this philosophical debate mattered most was on the issue of
           the Quran. It was understood that the Quran is the Word of God, his
           attribute of speech. Is the speech of Allah eternal? If so, something apart
           from Allah, his speech, would be eternal. It would exist in eternity past
           alongside Allah. Theologians who defended tawhid, like the Jahmiya
           and the Mutazili, saw this as blasphemous in light of Allah’s absolute
           unity. It is clear why: It would mean there are two eternal entities, Allah
           and the Quran.
               To establish their case from scripture, the rationalists referred to
           verses in the Quran that seemed to situate its contents in history. If the
           Quran refers to events in Muhammad’s life, like the Battle of Badr, how
           could it be Allah’s eternal speech? More convincingly, they cited 43.2
           of the Quran, which says, “We have made it an Arabic Quran.” If the
           Quran was made, how could it be eternal? Thus the rationalists argued
           that the Quran was created, and that it taught the doctrine of its own
           creation. Anyone who disagreed was an enemy of tawhid.
               That is why when al-­Mamun declared the Quran to be a created




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 50                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                  The Islamic Inquisition   51

              book, he justified his proclamation by saying, “He who does not confess
              that the Quran is created has no belief in tawhid.” Those who believe
              in the eternality of the Quran, argued al-­Mamun, are “the worst of the
              Muslims” and “the tongue of the devil.” He instituted their inquisition.
                   Over the course of fifteen years and the reigns of three caliphs,
              Muslim thinkers in major cities who believed in the eternality of the
              Quran were interrogated, flogged, and threatened with execution
              because of their challenge to tawhid. One such man, Ahmad bin Nasr
              al-­K huzai, was brought before Caliph al-­Wathiq, who questioned him
              about the Quran. When it became clear that Ahmad did not subscribe
              to its createdness but believed in its eternality, the caliph flew into a rage
              and personally decapitated him. Ahmad’s head was taken to Baghdad
              and displayed publicly as a warning to others who might be tempted to
              make the same mistake.
                   Although such executions were not common, the victims of the
              Mihna included eminent theologians such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal,
              a founder of a major school of Sunni thought. Ultimately, it was the
              tenth Abbasid caliph, al-­Mutawakkil, who abolished the Mihna. Less
              passionate about his theology, he simply forbade argumentation on the
              nature of the Quran.
                   Although the Islamic inquisition thus came to an end, the arguments
              about the Quran did not. Ultimately, the majority of Muslims espoused
              a view exactly contrary to the defenders of tawhid. Based on the position
              of a man named al-­A shari, the average Muslim today believes that the
              Quran is eternal despite the problem this creates for tawhid. And how
              did al-­A shari counter the arguments of the rationalists? How can the
              Quran be eternal without challenging the absolute unity of Allah? His
              response is famous: bila kayf, or “without how.” In other words, there is
              no rational resolution; it is just true that the Quran is eternal and this
              does not contradict tawhid. In this proclamation al-­A shari emphasized
              revelation and tradition over reason and rationality, and his method has
              remained dominant among Muslim thinkers ever since.
                   Over time, and entirely without logical defense, al-­A shari’s position
              on tawhid became the standard view, changing the history of Islam for-
              ever. His position is so firmly entrenched that, ironically, those who take




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 51                                                     7/1/16 1:57 PM

           52   Tawhid or the Trinity?

           al-­Mamun’s position today face persecution. In 1995 a highly respected
           Egyptian scholar named Nasr Abu Zayd was declared an apostate by
           sharia courts on account of his belief that the Quran is partially created.
           His marriage was officially annulled, he received death threats, and he
           was effectively forced into exile. However, in more tolerant Muslim
           environments like Turkey, debates about tawhid and the Quran con-
           tinue unabated.
               The Mihna is now but an obscure footnote in the annals of Islamic
           history. Most Muslims today do not realize that in the eyes of their fore-
           runners, their beliefs about the Quran constitute a flagrant transgression
           of tawhid. Yet the debates of old echo into the present. If a Muslim is
           asked how belief in an eternal Quran does not challenge tawhid, they
           must still respond the way al-­A shari did over a thousand years ago: bila
           kayf. There is no rational response.


           CONFIDENCE IN TAWHID AND SKEPTICISM
           TOWARD THE TRINITY
           In my experience, devout Muslims are very proud of tawhid, their
           monadic conception of God. By contrast, they often see the Trinity as
           an indefensible, self-­contradictory, polytheistic doctrine, especially since
           most Christians are unequipped to articulate the Trinity or explain how
           it is monotheistic. It is because of this relative confidence in tawhid
           that the Trinity is one of the most common topics of Christian-­Muslim
           dialogue.1
                As a practicing Muslim, I simply had no idea of the contradictory
           forms of tawhid, nor of how volatile intra-­Muslim relations had been
           on account of them. I, and most Muslims I knew, simply thought that
           Islam’s doctrine of God was clearly defined, unanimously agreed upon,
           and entirely unproblematic. In other words, we uncritically believed
           that tawhid was an impervious doctrine.
                But the Mihna illustrates that Muslims have significant disagree-
           ments over tawhid, and there are multiple views in Islam. We have
           already explored the two views of tawhid in the Mihna that were con-
           trary enough to cause bloodshed. A third, equally divisive view is that




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 52                                                   7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                              The Islamic Inquisition   53

              of many Sufis, called wahdat al-­wujud. Literally translated “unity of
              being,” this doctrine teaches that the entire universe is God. It is so
              offensive to some Muslims that they denounce Sufis as kafir, infidels,
              under charges of pantheism. By contrast, Sufi Muslims often believe
              that their knowledge of Allah is the most intimate and refined form of
              Islam. These are just three of the divergent views on tawhid that have
              been widely held by devout Muslims throughout Islamic history.
                  The average Muslim is not aware of this. Perhaps more than any
              other reason, my ignorance was why I was so confident in lodging criti-
              cisms against the Trinity. I would point out that the word Trinity is not
              found in the Bible and that the doctrine took hundreds of years to iron
              out. How could a doctrine so central to Christian theology have had
              such a long and complicated history? But because I had not studied the
              history of tawhid, I did not know that the exact same criticisms applied
              to Islam: the word tawhid is not found in the Quran, and the doctrine
              also took hundreds of years to iron out.
                  When we take a closer look at these two doctrines, we find that taw-
              hid is similar to the Trinity in some other surprising ways, but as with
              our comparison of the Islamic and Christian worldviews, the differences
              are crucial. By the end of this section, we will see that the doctrine
              of tawhid is ultimately self-­defeating, whereas the Trinity is not only
              coherent but also what makes us truly human.

                            COMPARING TAWHID
                             AND THE TRINITY


           I  n 2003, while still in the throes of trying to convert my friend David
              Wood to Islam, I began watching debates with him. Out of the doz-
           ens of debates we watched, the Muslim debater for whom I had the most
           respect was Shabir Ally. He spoke warmly, had strong stage presence,
           and seemed very conversant with both Islam and Christianity. I had the
           privilege of watching him debate the following year in my hometown
           before an audience of nearly a thousand Muslims and Christians. I con-
           sidered him the best Muslim debater in the world, and truth be told, I
           was a bit starstruck to see him live.
               Had someone told me that I myself would debate him someday, I
           would never have believed it!
               I received an invitation to debate Dr. Ally in the spring of 2015 at
           Wayne State University in Michigan. After much prayer and delibera-
           tion, I decided to agree, and I deferred to Dr. Ally for the topic. When I
           received his reply, my heart sank: He wanted to debate the Trinity.
               Even though I had been a Christian for nine years and a full-­time
           minister for five of those years, I still felt that the doctrine of the Trinity
           was at best something Christians could explain and defend; it was not a
           compelling doctrine and certainly not something to draw people’s atten-
           tion toward. But I had already agreed to the debate and allowed Dr. Ally
           to set the topic, so I could not back out now. As it seemed to me, I had
           stumbled into a debate with the best Muslim apologist in the world on
           the most difficult topic for Christians to defend. What was I to do?
               There was nothing I could do except pray and study in earnest! So,

                                                      Comparing Tawhid and the Trinity   55

              joined by good friends and colleagues, I spent many hours with my
              knees on the ground and many hours more with my nose in the books.
              It was during that time, through prayer and study, that I discovered
              how magnificent the Trinity is, and how compelling it is when we trace
              it throughout Scripture and understand its implications. Studying the
              doctrine of the Trinity greatly increased my love for God.
                  It was also during those studies that I first came across the story of
              the Mihna. When I discovered it, I was shocked. An Islamic inquisition
              over tawhid? Tawhid had a developmental history? The insights I gained
              by studying tawhid more carefully have since given me much more con-
              fidence in presenting the Trinity to Muslims.
                  My first discoveries were the similarities between tawhid and the
              Trinity. Theologically, the debates about the Trinity among Christians
              unfolded in surprisingly similar ways as the debates about tawhid among
              Muslims. In order to understand this, it is very important to note that
              the Quran and Jesus serve as analogues in their respective religions. In
              the case of Islam, the Quran is the eternal Word of God, and in the case
              of Christianity, Jesus is the eternal Word of God (John 1:1–14).
                  This is more than a semantic coincidence. For Muslims, the expres-
              sion of Allah in the physical world is the Quran, and for Christians, the
              expression of Yahweh in the physical world is Jesus. That is why each
              religion teaches their eternality: They are expressions of an eternal God.
                  But both of these doctrines were hammered into shape on the
              anvil of intrareligious debate. As we have seen, this posed a significant
              problem for Islamic theology, because tawhid has traditionally taught
              that there is no division within Allah. How can the Quran, something
              that is in some sense separate from Allah, be an eternal expression of
              Allah without jeopardizing his absolute unity? Bila kayf.
                  Christian theology, on the other hand, does not have a problem with
              the Word of God being an eternal expression of God that is in some
              sense separate from God, because it does not teach the absolute unity of
              God. It teaches that Yahweh is three in one.
                  But what does it mean for God to be three in one? Let’s make sure we
              have a good definition of the Trinity before we examine why Christians
              believe it.

           56   Tawhid or the Trinity?


           DEFINING THE TRINITY: DOES IT CONTRADICT ITSELF?
           The Trinity is just like every other monotheistic doctrine in teaching that
           there is only one God. If we miss this, we miss everything! Christianity
           has always taught that there is only one God. Where Christian theology
           differs from other forms of monotheism is not on the number of gods,
           but on the concept of God’s personhood. The doctrine of the Trinity
           teaches that the one God exists as three persons.
               It is at this point that Muslims often level a charge of self-­
           contradiction, but it certainly is not, and here is why: person is not the
           same as being. Your being is the quality that makes you what you are,
           but your person is the quality that makes you who you are. For example,
           we are humans. That is what we are. That is why we are called human
           beings. But what we are is not the same as who we are. If someone asks,
           “Who are you?” I should not respond by saying, “A human!” That
           answers the question of what I am, not who I am. Who I am is Nabeel;
           that is my person. What I am is a human; that is my being. Being and
           person are separate.
               Unlike a human being, which has only one person, God has three
           persons. He is one being, Yahweh, in three persons: Father, Son, and
           Spirit. He’s more than able to exist like that because he is God. If we
           say God must have only one person, like humans, then we are making
           God in our image. Who are we to limit God? It is up to God to tell us
           who he is.
               That is where the discussion should really be between Muslims and
           Christians: on revelation, not on the conceptual plane of “Trinity versus
           tawhid,” as if our reason alone can dictate or even decipher the nature
           of God. Based on their traditional teachings, Muslims and Christians
           should agree that God is greater than we can possibly conceive, more
           complex than we could ever hope to grasp. We are in no position to
           determine the intricacies of God’s nature. If he were to inform us that
           he is one being in one person, we are obligated to believe him. If he tells
           us, “I am one being in three persons,” who are we to say no to God?
           As believers in revelation, we must turn to divine Scripture to learn
           about God.

                                                        Comparing Tawhid and the Trinity   57


              THE TRINITY IN THE BIBLE
              Scripture is the reason why Christians believe God is triune. The doc-
              trine of the Trinity is the best interpretation of the Bible. Just as the
              Quran does not systematically expound upon the doctrine of tawhid,
              the Bible does not expound upon the doctrine of the Trinity in any one
              place. However, there are five elements found repeatedly throughout
              the Bible’s text that are best interpreted through the lens of the Trinity:

                  1. There is only one God (e.g., Rom. 3:30)
                  2. The Father is God (e.g., John 6:27)
                  3. Jesus is God (e.g., John 20:28; Rom. 9:5; 2 Peter 1:1)
                  4. The Holy Spirit is God (e.g., Acts 5:3–5)
                  5. These three are distinct persons (e.g., John 14:16–17)

                  So if there are three distinct persons that are God, but there is only
              one God, we are naturally led to the doctrine of the Trinity: one God
              who subsists in three persons.
                  A verse that indicates the unity of these three distinct persons is
              Matthew 28:19, which says, “Go and make disciples of all nations, bap-
              tizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
              Spirit” (NIV). All three persons in this verse share one name, because
              they are one being.1
                  Now you may have noticed that the above verses are found in the
              New Testament. A common question that Muslims ask is, “If God is a
              Trinity, why do we have to wait until the New Testament to see it? Why
              did God not even give a hint of the Trinity before?” My answer often
              surprises them: He did, starting with the very first verse of the Bible.
                  Genesis 1:1 reads: “In the beginning God created the heavens and
              the earth” (NIV). If we look more closely at the word we translate
              “God,” Elohim, we see it is plural. If we were to translate it literally, we
              would translate it “Gods.” But the reason we do not translate it that
              way is because the verb in the sentence is singular. The word Elohim is
              plural, but the verse treats it as a singular noun. So, in the very first verse
              of the Bible, we see that God is in some sense plural, but in some sense




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 57                                                    7/1/16 1:57 PM

           58   Tawhid or the Trinity?

           singular. This fits the model of the Trinity perfectly: God is in one sense
           plural in terms of his persons, but in another sense singular in terms of
           his being. A monadic interpretation of God makes less sense of the verse.
                Of course, if it were just this one instance, there would not be much
           of a case, but we find three indications of God’s plurality in Genesis 1.
           The second is found in verse 26, where God says, “Let us make man in
           our image” (NIV). He refers to himself in the plural. Why would God
           call himself “us”? Some people respond that it is a plural of majesty; a
           king might refer to himself as “we,” and indeed, Allah does this through-
           out the Quran. Such an explanation is anachronistic, though. Biblical
           Hebrew does not use the plural of majesty, and it is probable that such a
           literary device had not been invented yet. To say that the Bible is using a
           plural of majesty is to apply later manners of speaking and writing to the
           Bible, which is poor methodology. God is not referring to himself here
           with a “royal we.” God is pointing out that, in some sense, he is plural.
                Another indication of his plurality is found in verse 27, which reads:
           “And God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he
           created him; male and female he created them.” After emphasizing that
           God created mankind in his image, the Bible then says he created them
           male and female. That’s not to say God has genders, but it is to say that
           there is plurality in his image. This is reflected in Scripture’s use of him
           to refer to mankind, and then its switch to them. Mankind is in one
           sense singular, one humanity, but in another sense plural, composed of
           men and women. That is the image of God: both singular and plural.
                So when we read the chapter carefully, we see that there are three
           indications in the very first chapter of the Bible that God is plural and
           singular. The Trinity is in the Bible from the very first verse, even
           multiple times in the very first chapter.
                Before moving on, it is worth mentioning that the Trinity is implicit
           throughout the Old Testament. In Genesis 18, we find Yahweh coming as
           a man to speak with Abraham, informing him that he will destroy Sodom
           and Gomorrah. Then, in verse 19:24, the Bible says, “Yahweh rained
           down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—­from Yahweh out of
           the heavens.” Yahweh appears to be both on earth and in the heavens,
           the person on the earth raining down sulfur from the person in heaven.

                                                      Comparing Tawhid and the Trinity   59

                  Lest it appear that this is not what Genesis is saying, Amos 4:11
              confirms this interpretation: “ ‘I overthrew some among you as God
              overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah . . .’ declares Yahweh.” Here, Yahweh
              refers to God in the third person. This makes little sense within a mon-
              otheistic framework unless we read the Old Testament through the lens
              of the Trinity.
                  Finally, an example of a passage in the Old Testament that features
              the deity of all three persons of the Trinity can be found in Isaiah
              48:12–16. The clarity of the statement can be lost because of the many
              statements emphasizing the sovereignty of the speaker, but if we remove
              the intervening statements, the passage reads: “ ‘I am he; I am the first
              and the last. Indeed, my own hand established the earth . . .’ and now
              the Lord God and his Spirit have sent me.” Here, the Alpha and the
              Omega says he was sent by the Lord God along with his Spirit. The
              next verse calls the speaker “Yahweh,” “Redeemer,” and “the Holy One
              of Israel.” In this passage, Yahweh is sent by Yahweh and the Spirit of
              Yahweh, and this makes little sense unless read through the lens of
              the Trinity.


              THE TRINITY AND TAWHID IN THE QURAN
              Just as the Bible is the reason Christians believe in the Trinity, the
              Quran is the reason Muslims deny it. The clearest rejection of the
              Trinity in the Quran is 4.171. After denying the deity of Jesus, it says:
              “Do not say ‘three.’ (It would be) better for you (if you) stop. Only Allah
              is God. One.”
                   But when we study the Quran more carefully, it appears the Quran
              is not actually denying the Trinity but rather polytheism, that Jesus is
              a second deity alongside God. For example, after denying that Jesus is
              God, 5.73 says, “Certainly they are infidels who say, ‘truly, God is the
              third (of) three.’ There is no god but one God.” If the Quran envisions
              the Trinity as three gods, with Allah as one and Jesus as the second, who
              is the third? Apparently it is Mary, as is most clear in 5.116, where Allah
              says to Jesus: “Did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as
              two gods in addition to Allah’?”




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 59                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

           60   Tawhid or the Trinity?

               So the trinity that the Quran denies is actually tritheism, three
           gods: Allah, Jesus, and Mary. At this point, some Christians argue the
           Quran gets the Trinity wrong, and this disproves the Quran. Muslims
           often argue in response that there very well may have been Christians
           that worshiped Mary, Jesus, and God as a trinity, and that the verses of
           the Quran are directed toward them. I choose to avoid this discussion,
           emphasizing instead that the Quran effectively denies polytheism, three
           gods, not the concept of a triune God as Christianity has traditionally
           taught.2
               Throughout the rest of the Quran, Allah regularly says that there
           is only one God (e.g., 16.51; 47.19; 112.1), but always as a rejection of
           polytheism. The Quran never rejects the possibility of one God subsisting
           in three persons. The omission is noteworthy, as this had been the ortho-
           dox doctrine of Christianity for centuries before Muhammad and the
           advent of the Quran.


           THE NINETY-­NINE NAMES AND TRANSCENDENCE OF ALLAH
           In addition to denying polytheism, the Quran expounds upon the tran-
           scendence of Allah, that he intentionally keeps himself removed from
           mankind. He remains behind a veil, as it were, speaking to humans
           only through angels. Verse 42.51 says, “It is not for any human being
           that Allah should speak to him except by revelation, or from behind a
           partition, or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission,
           what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.”
                This verse is instructive for two reasons. In the last sentence, “He is
           Most High and Wise,” we find an example of the epithets the Quran
           uses to describe Allah, also called the ninety-­nine names. The Quran
           tells Muslims to call upon Allah by any of his names (17.110), and
           Muslims often urge one another to learn these names to gain deeper
           knowledge of Allah’s character.
                Also instructive is the implication of Allah’s transcendence: It is not
           for man to know him intimately. This is also reflected in his ninety-­
           nine names, as there are no names that indicate Allah desires intimacy
           with man. The two possible exceptions are al-­Wali and al-­Wadud.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 60                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                      Comparing Tawhid and the Trinity   61

              Some understand al-­Wali to mean “the Friend,” but really it means “the
              Patron,” and it emphasizes the protection of Allah, not a relationship
              with him. The other word, al-­Wadud, is more promising, as it does mean
              “the Loving” and is used twice in the Quran. But when we look more
              closely at the word, it seems an expressive idea is in view rather than a
              relational idea, as in “the Affectionate.” This might seem like splitting
              hairs, but it is an important distinction. Only one of Allah’s ninety-­nine
              names could imply he wants intimacy with man, and looking carefully
              at this word yields nothing that necessitates a relationship.
                   Of course, it would help if we had more context for the term, but
              we find only two instances of the word in the Quran; and since they are
              epithets, surrounding words do not clarify the meaning. Considering
              the broader context is illuminating, however: In 11.90, al-­Wadud is used
              to describe Allah just one verse after a warning, “Let not your dissension
              from me cause you to be struck,” and in 85.14, it is only two verses after
              the warning, “Indeed, the vengeance of your Lord is severe.” Neither
              occurrence inspires confidence that Allah wants an intimate relation-
              ship with humans.
                   Truly, nothing else in the Quran appears to indicate that Allah
              wants a relationship with humans. This is especially true of a father-­
              child relationship, as the Quran specifically denies that Allah is a father
              (112.3), and in 5.18 it rebukes the idea of God’s spiritual fatherhood:
              “The Jews and the Christians say, ‘We are the children of Allah and
              His beloved.’ Say (in response), ‘Then why does He punish you for your
              sins?’ Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created.”
                   This verse is telling. When Jews and Christians suggest that they
              are children of God, the Quran says to castigate them and inform them
              that they are nothing but his creatures, as are all humans. We must also
              note that this verse actually does use the primary and best word for
              “love” in Arabic, habb, but it uses it to explicitly deny that people are
              God’s beloved.
                   This may come as a shock to Muslims who grew up as I did, being
              taught that Allah loves us. It is a common teaching among Muslims, but
              it is not the teaching of the Quran. A verse that is often used to suggest
              that Allah is close to us is 50.16, which says that Allah is nearer to

           people than their jugular veins. What I was not taught, and what most
           Muslims I know are not taught, is that this verse is in the context of an
           extended threat: Allah is so close to you that he knows your subversive
           thoughts very well, and he throws doubters into hell.3
               So indeed, as part of our understanding of tawhid, we need to include
           a balanced understanding of Allah’s self-­revelation. Allah intends man
           to pursue the relationship of a servant to his master, but not the relation-
           ship of a child with his father. Nothing in the Quran suggests that Allah
           desires intimacy with humanity. We are not his beloved—­just one of
           his creatures.


           REMOVED VERSUS RELATIONAL
           There is an intrinsic reason why Allah does not desire a relationship
           with humans, whereas Yahweh does. On account of tawhid, Allah is
           a monad; he is not inherently relational. Yahweh, on the other hand,
           is three persons; he is inherently relational. The implications are far-­
           reaching. When Muslims say, “Allahu-­Akbar,” they mean “God is great,”
           and Christians would agree with that.4 Both Muslims and Christians
           believe that God is the greatest being in the universe. But if Allah is the
           greatest, and in his nature he is removed and does not desire a relation-
           ship, then Islam exalts the qualities of being removed and nonrelational.
                On the other hand, if Yahweh is the greatest being, and intrinsic to
           his nature are intimacy and love, then Christianity exalts relationships
           and community. Remember from chapter 2 that the one God exists as
           three persons who selflessly love one another; love is therefore the central
           principle of God (1 John 4:8). It is out of that selfless love that he created
           this universe, and he expects it to function through love in reflection of
           him. That is exactly why the Bible teaches what it does: “ ‘You shall love
           the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with
           all your mind.’ This is the great and first commandment. And a second
           is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself’ ” (Matt. 22:37–38).
           Since God is the greatest being, relational and loving, relationships and
           love are the most important commandments for mankind.
                According to Christian teachings, God is our Father. He loves us

              as a perfect Father, and he will always love us so. He wants us to have
              an intimate relationship with him, turning to him with our fears and
              failures, with our dreams and victories. He wants us to rejoice with him
              and in him. This is all because God is triune, and in his very nature he
              is love. This is all very different from the traditional doctrines about
              Allah in Islam.

                   QUESTIONING COMPLEXITY


           I  n the 1920s, a scientific discovery revolutionized the world for-
              ever. Until that time, physics had been considered one of the most
           unchanging, well-­   understood fields of scientific knowledge. Isaac
           Newton’s principles had been proven sound again and again and
           again, for hundreds of years. Some nineteenth-­century physicists, such
           as Pierre-­Simon Laplace, even began to boast that science was now
           equipped to explain all movements in the entire universe, both past
           and future. Man, it seemed, had conquered physics.
               But near the turn of the twentieth century, scientists started noticing
           cracks in their understanding of the world. In particular, the behavior
           of light did not always fit into Newton’s box. Through the work of
           intellectual giants like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and
           Erwin Schrödinger, physicists began to discover the hidden secrets of
           light. Combining the insights gained through the 1920s, Paul Dirac
           published his Principles of Quantum Mechanics, and the world would
           never be the same.
               One of Dirac’s students, John Polkinghorne, shares how Dirac
           explained the discovery to his students at Cambridge. “He took a piece
           of chalk and broke it in two. Placing one fragment on one side of his
           lectern and the other on the other side, Dirac said that classically there
           is a state where the piece of chalk is ‘here’ and one where the piece
           of chalk is ‘there,’ and these are the only two possibilities. Replace the
           chalk, however, by an electron and in the quantum world there are not
           only states of ‘here’ and ‘there’ but also a whole host of other states that
           are mixtures of these possibilities—­a bit of ‘here’ and a bit of ‘there’
           added together.”1

           64

                   In other words, something can be in two places at once in ways that
              are contradictory to reason. According to Polkinghorne, “Quantum
              theory permits the mixing together of states that classically would be
              mutually exclusive of each other. It is this counterintuitive possibility of
              addition that marks off the quantum world from the everyday world of
              classical physics.”2 This realization, a counterintuitive and apparently
              self-­contradictory truth, is opening the door to twenty-­first-­century
              advances in technology that mankind could only have dreamed of
              before: technologies like MRIs, smartphones, and Blu-­R ay players all
              owe their existence to quantum physics, and fields like quantum com-
              puting and quantum optics keep the future full of promise.
                   As a Muslim, I had been taught from childhood that the doctrine of
              the Trinity was not possible because it was too complex and even self-­
              contradictory. But the more mankind probes the universe, the more we
              discover its dazzling complexity. As my eyes opened to the deeper truths
              of the world, I accepted that complexity does not somehow invalidate
              the Trinity. Why must we assume the Creator is any simpler, any easier
              to understand, than his creation?
                   I might suggest that the opposite must be true: By definition, we
              cannot comprehend God. If God created our minds, then he must be
              greater than their comprehension. Who are we to demand that he be
              simple enough for us to understand him?
                   But as we have seen, the Trinity is not contradictory. There is no
              contradiction in asserting that the one God exists in three persons. The
              common challenge from Muslims that the Trinity is unrealistically
              contradictory and complex is not a valid problem. Quite the opposite,
              as we have already learned through the story of the Mihna, the Islamic
              formulation of divine simplicity causes problems in explaining the eter-
              nality of the Quran. As we will learn now, the simplicity of tawhid has
              another flaw.


              TAWHID, THE TRINITY, AND THE SELF-­SUFFICIENCY OF GOD
              Let us consider again the basic teaching of tawhid: God is absolutely
              one. This means that, in eternity past, before he had created anything,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 65                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           66   Tawhid or the Trinity?

           Allah was alone. One person, all by himself. It was not until he chose
           to create the universe that Allah had anything to relate with. This is a
           significant theological problem because, through the ninety-­nine names
           and otherwise, Islam teaches that Allah is a relational being. But if he
           had nothing to relate with before creating the universe, how could he be
           a relational being?
                It is important to note that here I am using the word relational
           not in the sense of intimacy but in the sense of existing in relation to
           something else. For example, Islam teaches that Allah is ar-­Rahman
           and ar-­Raheem, the Gracious and the Merciful. Every devout Muslim
           knows this, because these are two of the most commonly invoked names
           of Allah. But these qualities imply that Allah is relational, that he is
           gracious to someone and that he is merciful to someone. He might have
           the potential to be gracious all by himself, but he cannot actually be
           gracious until there is something else to be gracious toward. The same is
           the case with mercy; something else needs to exist and receive his mercy
           for Allah to be intrinsically merciful.
                So in order for Allah to actually be gracious and merciful, he has to
           first create the universe. In other words, Allah is dependent upon his
           creation in order to be Allah. He cannot be ar-­Rahman or ar-­Raheem
           until he creates the world to be gracious or merciful toward. Allah’s
           qualities are contingent upon creation. Therefore it is irrational to say,
           as does traditional Islamic teaching, that Allah is intrinsically gracious
           or merciful or any other relational attribute, whether found in the
           ninety-­nine names or not. If Allah is a monad, he needs his creation to
           be relational.
                On the other hand, the doctrine of the Trinity teaches that the three
           persons of God have eternally loved one another with a selfless love. God
           has always been relational, always been loving. His mercy and justice are
           not contingent upon his creation, because they are the expression of
           his eternal love toward humans. That love was never contingent upon
           mankind’s existence.
                Because of tawhid, Allah depends on mankind in order to be Allah.
           Because of his triune nature, Yahweh is truly independent and self-­sufficient.
                So the simplicity of tawhid proves to be a fatal flaw for orthodox




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 66                                                     7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                Questioning Complexity   67

              Islam on two accounts: its inability to explain the eternal Quran, and
              the consequence that it makes Allah dependent upon his creation. Far
              from being self-­contradictory, the complexity of the Trinity is what
              makes him logically consistent and self-­sufficient.
                  A more apropos question that Muslims ask regards Scripture. Jews
              and Muslims agree that God is a monad, not three persons. Doesn’t the
              Jewish understanding of monotheism come from the Bible, and doesn’t
              it deny a Trinity?


              THE SHEMA: “THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE”
              The most important Scripture for considering Jewish monotheism is
              the shema. It is the Jewish analogue of the shahada, and it is found in
              Deuteronomy 6:4. It reads, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord Our God, the
              Lord is one” (NIV). But we must be careful to understand the Hebrew
              and its nuances. In the first place, the verse can be translated: “Hear,
              O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone,” as the New Revised
              Standard Version of the Bible translates it. But even if we translate it
              as “the Lord is one,” what kind of “one” does the Hebrew refer to? An
              absolute unity, like tawhid teaches, or a composite unity, like male and
              female making up one mankind, as we saw in Genesis 1?
                  The word for “one” used in the shema is echad, and this is often
              the word the Old Testament uses to refers to a composite unity. To
              illustrate, let’s revisit Genesis 1. Verse 5 says that evening and morning
              make one day. In other words, one day is a composite of evening and
              morning. Since the Scripture is referring to something that is one but
              made up of multiple components, it uses the word echad. In Numbers
              13:23, a cluster of grapes is referred to as echad, since the one cluster is
              composed of many grapes. In Ezekiel 37:17, Ezekiel is told to hold two
              sticks together as if they were one; again, in Hebrew the word echad
              describes this compound unity. As a final example, referring back to the
              image of male and female, the Bible says that, through marriage, man
              and woman become one. The word the Bible uses to express two-­in-­one?
              Of course, echad. So when the shema says, “The Lord is echad,” the Bible
              specifically uses that word, which allows it to mean a composite unity.3




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 67                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

           68   Tawhid or the Trinity?

                Putting this together with our Scripture references from earlier in
           the chapter, the Bible tells us that there is only one God, Yahweh. The
           New Testament is clear that three separate persons are each God, but
           they are not each other. So we must conclude that the one God sub-
           sists in three persons. The Old Testament, starting from the first page,
           frankly suggests that God is multiple in persons, and the shema uses
           verbiage we would expect if Yahweh wanted us to know that he is one
           God in three persons.


           JEWS AND THE TRINITY
           When I mention these findings to Muslims, they often ask me why
           Jews do not interpret the Scriptures to say that the one God might have
           multiple persons or expressions. They are surprised when I respond that
           some did! One example is the Zohar, the famous and highly revered
           foundational text of Jewish mystical thought. While considering the
           wording of the shema, it says: “These three are one . . . So it is with the
           mystery of the threefold Divine manifestations designated by ‘the Lord,
           our God, the Lord’—­three modes which yet form one unity.”4
               But the belief that Yahweh was multiple in person or expressions
           goes beyond the mystical rabbis to the time of Jesus himself. Alan Segal,
           a Jewish scholar, argues that some first-­century Jews held a “binitarian”
           notion of God.5 Daniel Boyarin, himself an orthodox Jew and a scholar,
           argues that rabbis declared such notions to be heretical only in response
           to Christian theology, not before.6 In other words, according to some
           notable Jewish scholars, views like the Trinity were present among
           Jews when Jesus was teaching in Israel. Only after Jews and Christians
           parted ways did rabbis declare such notions heretical, as a reaction to
           Christian theology.

                                           Chapter 8



                  DO MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS
                    WORSHIP THE SAME GOD?


              I  n April 2015 I had an opportunity to encourage Christian students
                 to reach out to their Muslim neighbors. It was a chapel service at a
              Christian college in upstate New York, and at the center of the mostly
              Caucasian audience was an Iraqi woman clearly distinguishable by her
              hijab, the headscarf that Muslim women commonly wear.
                  I have learned the hard way that, whenever I address an audience,
              I should try my best to present my message without offending people
              more than I have to. If people are going to find the gospel offensive, I
              would rather it not be on account of my presentation. So for the allotted
              hour, I was trying to read her reaction to my arguments and testimony,
              but she showed no reaction whatsoever. She simply listened. At least she
              was not obviously offended—­so far so good!
                  At the very end of my presentation, a woman in the audience asked
              me a controversial question: “Do Muslims and Christians worship the
              same God?” My answer to this question had offended Muslims in the
              past, and I was worried it would do so again. But another thing I have
              learned the hard way is, when asked a question, I should try to answer it
              directly. So I offered a quick prayer in my heart and began.
                  I started by stating the obvious: Christians worship Yahweh, the
              Trinity, whereas Muslims worship Allah, a monad. This is not an inci-
              dental difference; Islam makes every effort to condemn the Trinity as
              blasphemy (4.171). The Quran rejects the relational aspects of God,
              saying that he is not a father (5.18) and he is not a son (112.3). It
              establishes its own doctrine of God, tawhid, in diametric opposition to

                                                                                    69




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 69                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

           70   Tawhid or the Trinity?

           the Trinity, and that doctrine becomes the central doctrine of Islamic
           theology.
                Most people who say Christians and Muslims worship the same God
           are aware of this difference, but they treat it as relatively inconsequen-
           tial. This is not a trivial difference, though; it has major implications.
           Since mankind is made in the image of the triune God, love is woven into
           our very nature. The Trinity gives us the most consistent, most powerful
           basis for being self-­sacrificial and altruistic.
                This is an important point to unpack. Of course, many people are
           very altruistic, regardless of their worldviews. A person does not need
           to believe in God to genuinely care for others, as secular humanists
           demonstrate. There are even people who do not believe in any kind
           of morality yet still desire to care for people. Ultimately, though, such
           ungrounded altruism is a sentiment, something a person just wants
           to do. Unless one believes in a transcendent basis for altruism, one’s
           desire to care for people is unanchored and ephemeral, little more than a
           whim. According to this amoral worldview, nothing behooves a person
           to be kind. Even though someone might wish to be altruistic, in the
           next moment it would be entirely consistent with their worldview if they
           chose to be selfish.
                Others believe in a morality that is essentially derived from evolu-
           tionary theory. People ought to take care of one another because the
           enterprise of life is to survive, and we ought to be mindful of other
           members of our species. Although this is a somewhat more grounded
           basis for altruism, it is ultimately still a weak foundation: Why should
           I, a thinking individual, subscribe to the enterprise of life? What if I do
           not want humanity to survive? Furthermore, is it really altruistic of me
           to care for others if my main purpose in doing so is to care for my own
           species, and by extension, to care for myself?
                So atheistic altruism, though it may be sincere and practicable, is
           ultimately either sentimental or utilitarian and selfish. To root altruism
           more firmly, one needs to consider theistic models. In the case of Islam,
           Allah commands Muslims to take care of orphans, widows, paupers,
           wayfarers, and others. A Muslim can obey out of selfish purposes, such
           as a desire to avoid hell or obtain heaven, or he can obey out of a selfless

                                           Do Muslims and Christians Worship the Same God?   71

              desire to please God. So theism, as in the case of Islam, offers a more
              deeply grounded form of altruism.
                   But the Christian model of theism goes further still. Much further.
              Remember that the eternal love of God is intrinsic to who he is; each
              person of the Trinity loves the others selflessly. It was out of this selfless
              love that God created mankind. In other words, we were made in the
              image of a selfless, loving God, so in our very nature we are designed to
              be selfless and loving. When we are self-­centered instead of selfless, we
              act against our very nature.
                   From the Christian perspective, people ought to be selflessly loving
              toward others not just because it is a good idea, not just because it helps
              our species survive, not just because it earns us a reward, and not just
              because it pleases God. People ought to be selflessly loving because it is
              who we are. Humans are made in the image of a selfless God; loving
              others is what makes us truly human.
                   No other worldview so deeply embeds into mankind the obligation
              to love and care for one another. As a foundation for altruism, nothing
              outstrips the Trinity.
                   So I answered the woman’s question by emphasizing that Christians
              worship a triune God, and that this makes a great difference in how we
              see ourselves and the world around us. Shortly after my answer, the Iraqi
              woman approached me. With a thick Arabic accent, she thanked me for
              my talk, and with a thick American accent, I thanked her in return for
              listening so patiently. I asked what brought her to the Christian college,
              assuming it had been a Christian friend. Her answer gave me more than
              I bargained for.
                   She responded that, just five weeks prior, she had seen Jesus in a
              dream. He told her to go to a specific church in her town to learn the
              truth about him. At the church, a woman befriended her and shared
              the gospel with her. Without hesitation, she renounced her Islamic faith
              and accepted the good news of Jesus. Since that day, she had learned all
              she could about God, and when her friend found out I was speaking at
              the Christian college, she brought her along. It was her friend who had
              asked the question about whether we worship the same God!
                   So it turned out that the Muslim woman in the audience was not




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 71                                                      7/1/16 1:57 PM

           72   Tawhid or the Trinity?

           Muslim after all, but a new Christian sister. Out of curiosity, I asked
           her friend why she still wore a hijab, to which her friend responded they
           were so busy discussing Jesus that they had not yet had the opportunity
           to talk about it! I was very glad to hear that answer. There is nothing
           inherently wrong with a headscarf, and focusing on it would be a waste
           of time in comparison with learning the truth about Jesus.
               The question of whether Muslims and Christians worship the same
           God is complex, and there is much more that could be said.1 Ultimately,
           when we understand the Trinity, we realize that the doctrine is not
           just a theological curiosity. It has far-­reaching implications for how we
           ought to live and how we see the world, and it makes the Christian
           God categorically different from the Muslim God. It is what makes
           God relational, what makes his love eternal. It is how God can be in us
           through the Holy Spirit, while being over us as the Father, and suffering
           for us in the Son.
               And it is the Son that most distinguishes the Christian God from
           the Muslim God. We need to learn about him not only in light of the
           Trinity but also in light of his life on earth. Now that we understand
           the doctrine of the Trinity, that the one God subsists as three persons,
           we will better understand what Christians mean when they say that
           the second of the three persons entered into this world as a human
           named Jesus.

                         THE COUNCIL OF NICAEA


              T     he church held no political or military power in its first three
                    hundred years, subsisting on faith and perseverance in the face of
              persecution. Christian martyrdom did not mean dying with sword in
              hand, but laying down one’s life instead of one’s faith. The words of
              Jesus were still fresh in their memory—­“All who draw the sword will
              die by the sword” (Matt. 26:52 NIV)—­and the young church fought
              no battles whatsoever.
                  Ironically, Roman efforts to kill were the midwife of the church. It
              was the Roman prefect of Judea, Pontius Pilate, who unwittingly aided
              in laying the foundation of Christian faith by ordering Jesus’ crucifix-
              ion. A few years later, Nero heinously accused Christians of a crime
              he himself committed. The Roman historian Tacitus reports that Nero
              “falsely charged with guilt, and punished with the most fearful tortures,
              the persons commonly called Christians.”1 It was during this time of
              persecution by the emperor that Peter and Paul were executed. But by
              killing Jesus and the fathers of the church, the Roman empire galva-
              nized the Christian spirit: Many welcomed martyrdom, that they might
              be given the honor of following their Lord and his apostles in suffering
              for the sake of God. Tertullian testified to this indomitable spirit with
              his famous words: “We multiply whenever we are mown down by you;
              the blood of Christians is seed.”2
                  Christians faced these imperial or local persecutions episodically
              for almost three hundred years, and the night grew darkest just before
              the dawn. In February of AD 303, Emperor Diocletian ordered the
              destruction of a church and its Holy Scriptures, issuing edicts that the
              same be done to churches throughout the Roman Empire. The historian

                                                                                    75

           76   Muhammad or Jesus?

           Eusebius, an eyewitness to these events, tells us in his Ecclesiastical
           Histories, “Royal edicts were published everywhere, commanding that
           the churches should be razed to the ground, the scriptures destroyed
           by fire . . .” He goes on to say that the persecutions intensified in the
           coming days: “The first decrees were followed by others commanding
           that . . . those who refused (to offer sacrifices to Roman gods) should
           be tormented with countless tortures. Who could count at that time,
           again, the multitude of martyrs?” It was during this, the greatest and
           most sustained persecution of Christians by the Roman Empire, that a
           young man named Constantine rose to imperial office.
               In October of AD 312, Constantine was preparing to fight an army
           twice the size of his. While leading his soldiers on a march on the eve
           of battle, Constantine, according to Eusebius, was dazzled by a vision:
           a radiant cross above the sun, with words written in the sky, “By this,
           conquer.” The vision mystified Constantine, but that very night, Jesus
           appeared to him in a dream and told him to use the sign as a safeguard
           in all his engagements. So Constantine ordered his men to mark their
           shields with the Christian symbol. One can only imagine the soldiers’
           reluctance to bear the signs of a persecuted minority on their shields,
           but they complied. The next day, the soldiers won a decisive victory, and
           Constantine marched into Rome as its victorious Emperor.
               After his supernatural encounter, Constantine immediately worked
           to reverse the persecutions of Diocletian. By issuing the Edict of Milan
           in AD 313, he granted freedom of worship for all religions, Christianity
           as well as other persecuted minorities. This was a watershed moment in
           the history of the church: Not only were Christians allowed to worship
           without risking their lives, but also they were allowed their Scriptures
           and the ability to openly assemble. Finally, for the first time since the
           crucifixion of Jesus, all Christian leaders could openly gather to discuss
           their Scriptures and doctrines under the patronage of the empire, with-
           out retribution.

                                                                The Council of Nicaea   77


              THE COUNCIL OF NICAEA AND THE ARIAN CONTROVERSY
              The first and greatest concern of the bishops, a concern shared by
              Constantine, was the growing division within the church on account of
              a man named Arius and the teachings he espoused. To deliberate over
              Arius’s position, Constantine invited eighteen hundred bishops from
              throughout the Roman Empire, modern-­day Spain to Syria, to convene
              at Nicaea in AD 325. Even though he offered to provide their transpor-
              tation and lodging, only 318 had the ability to come. Some, such as the
              Bishop of Rome, were too advanced in age to attend, while others were
              physically incapable of making the journey due to disability from the
              persecutions or otherwise. Those who could come were described as “an
              assembly of martyrs” by church historian Theodoret. He describes Paul
              of Neo-­Caesarea, a bishop from modern-­day Turkey, as an example of
              one who “had suffered much from the cruelty of Licinius. He had been
              deprived of the use of both hands by the application of a red hot iron, by
              which the nerves that give motion to the muscles had been contracted and
              destroyed.” Other bishops at the council, such as Paphnutius of Egypt,
              had their eyes gouged or their limbs dismembered. Yet they braved the
              long journey to Nicaea for the sake of attending the discussions.
                  These men had lived through the greatest persecution of Christians
              the church had seen, suffering torture and dismemberment rather than
              compromising their faith. These were the men now summoned to dis-
              cuss the controversial teaching of Arius: “that the Son had a beginning,
              but that God was without beginning . . . He is neither part of God, nor
              of any subjacent matter.”
                  The council gave Arius the floor, allowing him to share and defend
              his position. To clarify, Arius emphasized that he did believe Jesus was
              divine. As he had said in a letter to the Bishop of Nicomedia, Arius
              believed that the Son, “does not derive his subsistence from any matter;
              but that by his own will and counsel he has subsisted before time, and
              before ages, as perfect god, only begotten and unchangeable, and that
              before he was begotten, or created, or purposed, or established, he was
              not. For he was not unbegotten.”
                  So Arius believed that Jesus was indeed a god, but not God. The




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 77                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           78   Muhammad or Jesus?

           Father had “begotten, or created, or purposed, or established” Jesus
           before time and the creation of the universe; God had created a second
           god. When what Arius believed became clear, the council recognized
           his teachings as polytheism, and since the church had always taught
           monotheism, they deemed Arius a heretic. With 316 of the bishops in
           agreement, the council promulgated the Nicene Creed, the first ecu-
           menical resolution of the church in history.


           NICAEA IN POPULAR MEMORY
           Seventeen hundred years later, the Council of Nicaea maintains a
           prominent place in popular memory, but the details are often misunder-
           stood, as demonstrated by an encounter I had with a young Muslim in
           June 2010. David Wood and I attended an Arab festival in Dearborn,
           Michigan, because we heard that the event attracted more than two
           hundred thousand Arabs, and we figured it would be an excellent
           opportunity to talk to people about Jesus. So, donning a shirt that read
           “Jesus Always Loves You,” I walked through the festival with David and
           waited for people to approach us with questions.
               We had a stimulating day with many enlightening discussions.
           While on our way out, a group of teenagers stopped us and indicated
           they had questions. Being a youth pastor at the time, I was always
           encouraged by connecting with teenagers interested in matters of faith,
           but this was particularly heartwarming because they had an air about
           them that reminded me of my childhood: confident zeal for Islam and
           utter skepticism of Christianity. I was not surprised at all when one of
           the first questions they asked involved Nicaea. A teenager asserted that
           Nicaea was “the first time they decided Jesus was God.”
               I was actually impressed with him for correctly identifying the sub-
           ject matter of the council. At the mosques I had attended as a youth,
           it was often repeated that Christians decided to take books out of the
           Bible at the Council of Nicaea and put other books in. I had challenged
           David with this assertion many years prior, but when we studied the
           council together, we discovered that it was entirely baseless. The books
           of the Bible were not even discussed at Nicaea. Since then I have noticed




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 78                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                 The Council of Nicaea   79

              that, for whatever reason, people choose to situate all kinds of imagined
              church conspiracies at this council. So it was encouraging that the
              teenager got the subject matter right, but he got the context of the pro-
              nouncement completely wrong. This was not when the church finally
              decided that Jesus was God.
                  On the other hand, when the church was finally able to gather for
              an ecumenical council after three hundred years of intermittent perse-
              cutions, their very first concern was to put the cornerstone of their faith
              beyond dispute: “Who is Jesus?” All 318 bishops present agreed that
              Jesus was divine. No one suggested that Jesus was just a human. And
              when both sides had heard all the arguments, over 99 percent were in
              agreement that Jesus is no lower than God himself. Not just human, not
              just a prophet, not just a god, but God: “very God of very God.”
                  There is a reason for the unanimous view: the belief that Jesus is
              “in very nature God” was one of the very first beliefs of the church.
              The gospel has always been purely about God and what he has done for
              mankind: He created them, he loved them, he lived among them, he
              saved them, he guides them, and his kingdom is at hand. One cannot
              understand the gospel without understanding this. The doctrine of
              Jesus’ deity makes a tremendous difference in how the Christian faith
              works and what it means to follow Jesus.
                  In the same way as Jesus’ deity is fundamental for Christian theology,
              Muhammad’s prophethood is fundamental to Islamic theology. There is
              a reason Muslims have to affirm Muhammad’s status as a prophet every
              time they recite the shahada. If Muhammad is not a prophet, orthodox
              Islam disintegrates.
                  When people gloss over Christianity and Islam as if they were the
              same, they overlook this fundamental fact: Jesus has a very different
              place in Christianity than Muhammad has in Islam. Deity is distinct
              from prophethood.
                  Apart from being exemplars for their followers, in virtually no way
              are Jesus’ and Muhammad’s positions parallel unless we conflate Islamic
              and Christian teachings. Let’s carefully consider the Christian view of
              Jesus and compare it to the Muslim view of Muhammad so we can
              understand exactly how they are different and why it matters.

                                           Chapter 10



                COMPARING THE MESSENGER
                    AND THE MESSIAH


           I  t has been a decade since I left Islam, and I have had some candid
              conversations with extended family members in that time. Amid the
           many abstract theological issues, I try to keep an eye out for the more
           visceral questions, as they tend to provide insight into where someone
           really stands. One such question that I am commonly asked is, “We
           respect Jesus, so why can’t Christians respect Muhammad?”
               In a sense, that is a fair question. Muslims rarely, if ever, say any-
           thing negative about Jesus, and I have heard Christians say very negative
           things about Muhammad. While I do agree that Christians ought to
           tread carefully when covering sensitive topics, this question is a classic
           example of inappropriately conflating the Muslim and Christian per-
           spectives. From my experience, what Muslims generally “respect” is the
           Islamic understanding of Jesus, not the Christian understanding.
               As an example, a family member who is particularly close to me
           once lamented that Muslims respect Jesus even though Christians do
           not respect Muhammad, yet in the very next breath he said that Jesus
           was “a weak and impotent God” if he died on a cross. When I objected
           that this was disrespectful to Jesus, he simply did not see it. It took a
           few moments to show him that, from my perspective, this was extremely
           offensive. He had a hard time understanding the offense, though,
           because he was so immersed in his own perspective.
               What he needed in order to understand the Christian perspective
           was an account of who Jesus is from the very beginning.

                                             Comparing the Messenger and the Messiah   81


              A GOD WHO COMES INTO THE WORLD
              As we saw in the previous chapter, the Quran explicitly says that Allah
              remains behind a veil, so Muslims conceive of God as a being who does
              not enter this world. Christians do not believe this, though, because
              their Scriptures teach exactly the opposite: The Bible repeatedly shows
              God coming among his people.
                   Starting with the third chapter of Genesis, the very beginning of the
              Bible, we find God walking in the garden where Adam and Eve were
              (Gen. 3:8). In Genesis 18, God appears to Abraham as a man and talks
              with him. In Exodus 34:5–6, God stood with Moses and walked in
              front of him. In Exodus 24:9–11, Aaron, Moses, and seventy-­t wo elders
              all saw God at the same time and even dined with him. In an even more
              tangible experience, Jacob wrestled with God in Genesis 32:24–28.
              In Exodus 13:21, when the Hebrews needed guidance in the desert,
              God personally led them as a pillar of smoke by day and a pillar of fire
              by night. In another, rather important account, God commanded the
              Hebrews to make him a tabernacle, a place where he would descend and
              “dwell among them” (Ex. 25:8–9 NIV). After they built it, God filled
              the tabernacle with his glory (Ex. 40:34). These many appearances of
              God on earth are often called theophanies.
                   Another theophany in the Torah, Exodus 3:4, actually has paral-
              lels in the Quran. In this passage, God calls to Moses from a burning
              bush. The bush was burning on account of the very presence of God,
              which is why God says, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you
              are standing is holy ground” (v. 5 NIV). There was nothing about the
              ground itself that was holy, but the presence of God made it holy. God’s
              presence in the bush is reflected in the Quran, 27.7–14. When Moses
              approaches the bush, a voice calls out from it, “Blessed is He who is in
              the fire.” The Quran also envisions Allah as physically present in the
              fire. That the ground was holy is reflected in 20.12, where God says,
              “Remove your shoes, you are in the holy valley of Tuwa.” As in the Bible,
              there is nothing inherently holy about the valley; it makes most sense if
              it has been sanctified by the presence of God.
                   Regardless of how a Muslim might interpret the Quran, though,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 81                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           82   Muhammad or Jesus?

           Christians have traditionally interpreted the passages from the Torah
           as theophanies. Yahweh is a loving God who desires intimacy with his
           people, so he comes among them.


           GOD PROMISED TO COME AS A CHILD
           During the days of Isaiah the prophet, God informed his people that he
           was about to do something special: He would be born into this world
           as a child. In Isaiah 9:6, the Bible says, “For to us a child is born, to
           us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he
           will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity,
           Prince of Peace.” Christians from the very beginning have understood
           this verse as being fulfilled in Jesus: God, having come to this earth
           repeatedly before, is announcing his coming incarnation. The Mighty
           God will be born as a child. This comes just a few chapters after Isaiah
           7:14, which says, “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and
           will call him Immanuel.” Putting this together, Christians believe that
           hundreds of years before Jesus, the Hebrews were told that God would
           be born among them.


           THE WORD BECAME FLESH AND TABERNACLED AMONG US
           When God finally did come to live among his people, a new era began.
           The Scriptures for this era are called the New Testament. According to
           early church tradition, John, one of Jesus’ three closest disciples, wrote
           an account of Jesus’ life in the New Testament called the gospel of John.
           He begins his account by reminding readers of who Jesus was before
           his life on earth. John 1:1–3 are immensely important verses for under-
           standing the Christian view of Jesus.
               As we learned in the previous chapter, Christians believe the one
           God exists as three persons, and the second person is the Word. Just as
           the Quran is separate from Allah in one sense yet an expression of his
           divine knowledge and speech in another, so Christians believe that the
           Word is separate from God in one sense and a part of him in another.
           This is exactly the teaching of John 1:1: “In the beginning was the Word,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 82                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                              Comparing the Messenger and the Messiah   83

              and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ”(NIV). The Word
              was with God (that is, separate from him in one sense); yet the Word was
              God (an expression of him in another sense).
                  The next verse teaches the corollary doctrine, that the Word is eter-
              nal. Again, just as Muslim theologians classically have taught that the
              Quran is the uncreated knowledge and speech of Allah, so the Bible
              teaches that the Word is eternal alongside the Father. “He was with God
              in the beginning” (John 1:2 NIV). From the very beginning, before
              time itself, the Word was present with God. It had to be, because it was
              an expression of God, who is eternal.
                  Also, just as Muslim scholars have traditionally taught that the
              Quran is best understood as Allah’s knowledge or speech, so the term
              for “Word” in Greek is Logos, and it embodies two concepts: reason and
              speech. These two meanings are captured in the English derivatives logic
              and dialogue. When God created the universe, he used his divine reason
              and his speech. These are the ideas embodied in the notion that God
              the Father created the universe through the Logos, found in John 1:3:
              “Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made
              that has been made” (NIV). So the universe was made through the
              Logos, the Word—­divine reason and speech.
                  Finally, departing from any parallel in Islamic theology, we find
              John 1:14: “The Logos became flesh and made his dwelling among us.”
              The Logos, the Word who is God, became a human and lived with us.
              According to John the disciple, that is Jesus Christ. Jesus is eternal, and
              it was through him that the universe was created.
                  What is fascinating about John 1 is that it is full of theology from
              the Torah, emphasizing that this is not a new belief but a continuation
              of what God had done at the time of Moses and the prophets of old.
              One example is the wording John chooses in verse 14. When he says
              the Word “made his dwelling” among us, he literally says the Word
              tabernacled among us, reminding his Jewish readers of the theophany in
              Exodus 40:34 and what God had done in the time of Moses. His glory
              was once again coming to dwell among man as he did in the tabernacle,
              but this time by being born as a human.
                  This is the Christian view of Jesus: The God who created the




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 83                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           84   Muhammad or Jesus?

           universe, who walked with Adam, who talked with Abraham, who
           wrestled with Jacob, who stood with Moses, who dined with Aaron,
           and who led the Hebrews—­that mighty God fulfilled his prophecy
           that he would be born as a human child to us. Jesus is “God with us,”
           the second person of the Trinity, the eternal Word through whom the
           universe was created.


           HE REALLY IS HUMAN
           Before moving on, it is important to emphasize that Christians really
           do believe that God became a human. He was born as a baby, he ate
           food, he grew in wisdom and in stature, he wept, he suffered, and he
           died. He did not just appear like a human; he became one. But by the
           word became, Christians do not envision a change to God’s nature. God
           never changed during any of the theophanies in the Torah, and he was
           not changing during his incarnation. Christians traditionally teach that
           God, rather than changing, was taking a human nature in addition to
           his divine nature. This doctrine is called the hypostatic union. When
           the Bible says that Jesus “grew in wisdom and in stature” or that Jesus
           died by crucifixion, Christians believe it is speaking with respect to his
           human nature, not his divine nature.
               Christians have traditionally taught that everything Jesus did on
           this earth, he did as a human. He taught as a human teacher, he received
           prophecies as a human prophet, and his miracles were performed as a
           human empowered by divine authority. This is why he tells his disciple
           Philip that people can do the works Jesus had been doing, and even
           greater (John 14:12).
               But though Jesus was a human, he was not of the lineage of Adam,
           who, we should recall from chapter 1, passed on his broken image to his
           progeny. Jesus, being born into the world by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35),
           was a human as humans were meant to be: unbroken. Since Jesus never
           sinned as a man, and since he also had a divine nature, he could forgive
           the sins of mankind by taking the penalty of sin himself. This is one
           reason why Christian theology would not work if Jesus were not God.
               Also, since Jesus was never broken by sin, he lived a perfect life as




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 84                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                              Comparing the Messenger and the Messiah   85

              an example of how all the rest of us ought to live it. Not an example in
              the sense of someone who made all the right choices, but an example in
              the sense of the perfect prototype, the one that all humans were made
              to be like.


              PROPHETS IN ISLAM: MEN TO FOLLOW
              Functioning as an exemplar is perhaps the only parallel between Jesus
              in Christianity and Muhammad in Islam, but even in this similarity,
              the mechanics are different. For Muslims, Muhammad is the perfect
              example not because he is the unbroken image in which we have been
              made, but because he is the most perfect instance of man, the greatest
              one who ever lived. Indeed, for some Muslims, Muhammad’s greatness
              is legendary.
                   When I was ten years old, my mother enrolled me in a Sunday school
              course run by our local mosque in Norfolk, Virginia. The mosque itself
              was a Sunni mosque, but the teachers and students came from many
              branches of Islam. I had two teachers there, a Sunni teacher of general
              Islamic knowledge and a Shia teacher of Quranic recitation. For all
              practical purposes we believed the same things, which is why my mother
              could enroll me there; but there are certainly differences between the
              traditions, and at times I heard things there I had not heard before.
                   One day, my general Islamic knowledge teacher spoke on the nature
              of Muhammad. He emphasized that “Muhammad had many roles:
              prophet, merchant, general, husband, father, son, and more. In every
              role, he performed to perfection.” So far so good. That was what I had
              always been taught. But then he said something new: “Muhammad
              never showed any emotional weakness. Had he cried and his tears fallen
              to the ground, the land would have become infertile!”
                   Although my parents highly exalted Muhammad, this was a step or
              two further than they had ever gone. Not all Muslims believe in this
              kind of superhuman status of Muhammad, but traditionally Muslims
              do see him as the greatest man who ever lived, and this account illus-
              trates how lofty a position some Muslims ascribe to the Prophet of Islam.
                   Prophethood in Islam is more than just a role. It is a status. Prophets




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 85                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           86   Muhammad or Jesus?

           are understood to be greater than the average person, assigned by Allah
           to lead a people. For Muhammad to be considered the Chief of the
           Prophets is truly quite a claim. It was on the basis of this prophetic sta-
           tus that Muhammad established his authority and promulgated Islam.
           Since Allah had made him a prophet, the religion he taught was true
           and ought to be followed.
               On the basis of their special status with Allah, Muslims popularly
           hold two beliefs about prophets: that all prophets are sinless, and that
           Allah would hear the cries of prophets in persecution and save them
           from death. However, the Quran seems to teach that prophets did sin
           (e.g., 28.15–16; 38.24–25; 47.19), and that they often were killed (e.g.,
           2.61; 3.183; 5.70). Accordingly, Muslim scholars tend not to agree with
           these common views, though they are not unanimous. Regardless, most
           Muslims do believe that Muhammad in particular was sinless, especially
           because Allah commands Muslims to follow him (33.21).


           THE PROPHET AND SHARIA
           Muhammad’s status as the perfect exemplar is one reason Muslims
           have undertaken immense efforts to record his life. Within a few cen-
           turies of his death, over five hundred thousand accounts from the life
           of Muhammad were in broad circulation. As we learned in the first
           chapter, these accounts are called the hadith, and they record details of
           Muhammad’s life ranging from anecdotes of his childhood to decisions
           he made as a general and statesman.
               As my Sunday school teacher taught, Muhammad had a series of
           roles and performed them perfectly. So when Muslims want an example
           of the perfect husband, or the perfect statesman, or the perfect general,
           or the perfect merchant, they turn to Muhammad’s life for exemplary
           guidance. The hadith record what Muhammad said and did in thou-
           sands of situations, and what he told the Muslim people to do in turn.
               This is why, unlike the teachings of Jesus that focus on principles
           and heart transformation, the guidance in Islam comes in the form of
           particulars. Sharia reaches the Muslim people in the form of thousands
           of decisions made by jurists and scholars who are familiar with the




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 86                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                             Comparing the Messenger and the Messiah   87

              traditions of Muhammad’s life. It all comes back to the exemplary life
              of the prophet.
                  So the primary basis for accepting Islam is that Muhammad is a
              prophet of God, and the guidance that he brings, sharia, is interpreted
              largely from the records of his life as an exemplary leader. For these
              reasons, Muhammad’s prophethood is foundational for Islam.


              MISUNDERSTANDING THE CHRISTIAN JESUS
              AND THE MUSLIM MUHAMMAD
              Some early orientalists, seeing so much emphasis on the person of
              Muhammad in Islam, labeled Muslims “Mohammedans.” When I was
              a Muslim, this title riled me because it seemed to imply that we wor-
              shiped Muhammad. I now realize that it was simply a matter of careless
              projection: The focus of the Christian faith is entirely upon the one
              we worship, so it is appropriate to call followers of Christ “Christians.”
              In Islam, although there is a tremendous amount of attention given to
              Muhammad, he is not the one Muslims worship, so it is galling to many
              Muslims to be called Mohammedans.
                  The same kind of misunderstanding occurs regularly in Muslim-­
              Christian dialogue, when Muslims assume Christians worship a man.
              Since I became a Christian, many Muslims have charged me of willfully
              worshiping creation rather than the Creator, but that is because they
              carelessly project Islamic views upon Christians: that Jesus is just a man,
              and that God does not come into this world.
                  If Muslims and Christians could understand one another on these
              points, dialogue would be far more fruitful. Let’s now take a look at
              common questions that can be clarified by what we have learned so far.

                  QUESTIONING THE GOD-­M AN


           I  n the summer of 2012, I spent eight weeks in Oakland, California,
              studying Arabic through Middlebury College. I had just graduated
           from Duke University, where I had focused on the Gospels and the
           Quran for my master’s degree. Even though my mother had taught me
           in my childhood how to recite Arabic, I could not use the language
           to communicate, so I knew that greater familiarity with Arabic would
           go a long way in my future graduate studies. I entered Middlebury
           just beyond the introductory level, which meant I would be prohib-
           ited from communicating in any language other than Arabic for the
           entire eight weeks. The program was so serious about this rule that we
           had to sign a contract the day we arrived. No English whatsoever, at
           any point, for two whole months. Not even during the evenings and
           weekends!
               Until that time, I had not realized just how important language is
           for relieving stress. No jokes, no storytelling, very little fellowship—­just
           a lot of hand gestures and listening to upperclassmen jabber away. It
           was a very trying time, but it forced us to quickly learn how to get by.
           Within a month, we were able to communicate with one another in
           what I am sure was horribly poor Arabic.
               Thankfully, I had a friend near Oakland who was also a student of
           Arabic, and she regularly reached out to immigrants in the area. She
           asked me if I would be willing to meet a Muslim friend of hers from
           Saudi, and I gladly agreed. Anything to spend time with a friend and
           get away from the campus! That afternoon, I met a lively young student
           named Sahar. She told me about life as a woman in Saudi, including that
           the government required her to get her younger brother’s permission

           88

                                                           Questioning the God-­M an   89

              so that she could study in America. When I asked what would have
              happened if he had refused, she replied, “He knows better than to say
              no to me!”
                  Soon the conversation turned to religious matters. Sahar indicated
              that she was resolutely Muslim and was not considering conversion, but
              she had questions about what Christians believed. After asking many
              questions, she at last asked me one that seemed to have been the most
              problematic for her. “How can you believe Jesus is God if he was born
              through the birth canal of a woman and that he had to use the bath-
              room? Aren’t these things below God?”
                  This question is a very common one, but we should now be able to
              see why Muslims ask it: Allah does not enter into this world in Islam,
              whereas Yahweh has repeatedly done so. Allah remains behind a veil
              and sends messengers, whereas Yahweh is intimate and walks among us.
                  When we remember that Yahweh is different from Allah, and that
              Jesus is the second person of the Trinity, the answers to many similar
              questions become readily apparent.


              HOW CAN GOD DIE, AND WHO WAS RULING
              THE UNIVERSE WHEN JESUS DIED?
              These two questions were the first ones I asked David about Jesus’
              deity when I was a Muslim, and they are the most common ones that
              Muslims ask me now. Since Islam does not have a concept of divine
              incarnation, these are understandable questions. Truly, they are ques-
              tions that Christians should ask themselves at some point, but they are
              not difficult to answer when we keep in mind what we have learned in
              this chapter.
                  When someone asks me, “How can God die?” I ask for clarification,
              because the question can be asked from multiple angles. Almost always
              the questioner says something along the lines of, “God is immortal, so
              he cannot die.” To that, I respond with a question in turn. “I see what
              you mean, but let me ask you a question: When humans die, do our
              souls stop existing?” Of course, Muslims respond, “No, our souls do
              not die,” to which I respond, “So even when we die as humans, it is the




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 89                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           90   Muhammad or Jesus?

           body that dies. It is not that we stop existing altogether. So it was with
           Jesus: He was killed with respect to his earthly body, but God did not
           stop existing.”
               Sometimes, though, by asking, “How can God die?” Muslims are
           essentially asking, “Who was ruling the universe?” There are many
           possible responses to this question, but the one I prefer is the simple
           one: the Father. This is why, if Muslims wish to engage in these kinds of
           questions, it is essential that Christians adequately explain the Trinity to
           them. The Father is not the Son, and the Father did not die on the cross.


           IT IS UNJUST FOR GOD TO PUNISH
           JESUS FOR THE SINS OF MAN
           This leads to another kind of question, one which even well-­informed
           Muslims will ask. During the closing statements of my 2015 debate,
           Dr. Shabir Ally used the most caustic terms I have ever heard to chal-
           lenge the gospel. He said that if the Father sent the Son to die for the sins
           of the world, then this was “cosmic child abuse.” What kind of a Father
           is God if he punishes his son for the sins of others?
               By this point, we should be able to readily see the problem with this
           assessment: Christians do not believe that God is punishing a random
           victim. Jesus is God. The Judge is himself voluntarily paying on behalf
           of the criminal. Against Dr. Ally’s caricature, a more apropos illustra-
           tion is shared by Brennan Manning in his book Ragamuffin Gospel.1
           In 1935, Fiorello LaGuardia, the mayor of New York, presided over a
           court case in which an old woman had been caught stealing bread to
           feed her grandchildren. Although LaGuardia wanted to offer her mercy,
           the shopkeeper demanded justice. LaGuardia judged her guilty and
           imposed a fine of ten dollars, but in the same moment he took ten dol-
           lars from his own wallet and paid the fine on her behalf. Acknowledging
           the woman’s guilt, the judge himself paid the penalty and let her go free.
               This is a beautiful illustration of mercy and justice, but if we tweak
           one minor detail it will accord better with the gospel: if LaGuardia had
           not just been the judge but also the shopkeeper from whom the woman
           stole. When we sin, we sin against God. He has to judge us guilty, but




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 90                                                   7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                            Questioning the God-­M an   91

              then he pays for what we have done. It all makes sense when we remem-
              ber the Christian view of Jesus: He is God.


              NO ONE HAS SEEN GOD
              Many Muslims have asked me how Jesus could be God if the Bible says
              “no one has ever seen God” (1 John 4:12 NIV). It makes sense that
              Muslims would ask this question, interpreting John’s epistle in light of
              tawhid, a monadic view of God. But John the disciple, the man through
              whom God authored this Bible verse, is also the author of the Gospel
              of John, and he interprets it for us in John 1:18: “No one has ever seen
              God; the only begotten God, who is at the Father’s side, has made him
              known.” In other words, when the Bible says “no one has ever seen
              God,” it is referring to God the Father. Jesus, who is God and at the
              Father’s side, has made him known. That is why Jesus is able to say to
              his disciple Philip, “Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father” (John
              14:9 NIV). Seeing Jesus is seeing God, tantamount to seeing the Father.
                  So although no one has seen God the Father, people have seen God
              the Son. This means that every time someone in the Bible saw God, they
              were seeing the second person of the Trinity, Jesus. When we remember
              that Jesus is the second person of the triune God, this otherwise prob-
              lematic verse is easy to understand.


              THE MAJESTY OF A KING
              Sahar’s question to me that summer afternoon in Oakland intuitively
              captured a sentiment that I think many Christians can learn from:
              God is King of the universe, unimaginably holy, and it is far beneath
              his majesty for him to be born on this filthy earth. So I affirmed her
              question, but then asked her one in turn. “Sahar, let’s imagine that you
              are on your way to a very important ceremony and are dressed in your
              finest clothes. You are about to arrive just on time, but then you see
              your daughter drowning in a pool of mud. What would you do? Let
              her drown and arrive looking dignified, or rescue her but arrive at the
              ceremony covered in mud?”




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 91                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           92   Muhammad or Jesus?

               Her response was very matter of fact, “Of course, I would jump in
           the mud and save her.”
               Nuancing the question more, I asked her, “Let’s say there were others
           with you. Would you send someone else to save her, or would you save
           her yourself?”
               Considering this, Sahar responded, “If she is my daughter, how
           could I send anyone else? They would not care for her like I do. I would
           go myself, definitely.”
               I paused for a short moment before continuing, “If you, being a
           human, love your daughter so much that you are willing to lay aside
           your dignity to save her, how much more can we expect God, if he is
           our perfectly loving Father, to lay aside his majesty to save us?” She
           considered this for a moment, and the conversation moved on. As the
           dinner ended, my friend returned me to my immersion Arabic program,
           where the idea of drowning was perhaps a bit too real for me.
               During my last week in Oakland, as the program was coming to
           a fruitful and merciful end, I received another text message from my
           friend inviting me out to dinner, this time to meet a new Christian
           from a Muslim background. When I arrived, I was met by a beaming
           Sahar! The message of God’s selfless love had overpowered her, and she
           could no longer remain Muslim. A few days after our dinner, she had
           accepted Jesus as her Lord and Savior. Now it was time to rejoice with
           her, share stories about our amazing God, and point the way forward
           for her discipleship.

                                           Chapter 12



                             LIBYA’S BEST FRIEND


              I  n early December 2013, David Wood and I happened to be in Texas
                 when the state was hit with a massive ice storm. The scene was sur-
              real. Normally warm and sunny vistas were bleak and barren, and cars
              were sliding off the road as streets were covered in thick sheets of ice.
              The sky was an opaque gray, and confusion permeated the air as airports
              were cancelling flights and people were scrambling to find ways out of
              the state.
                  We had just left an In-­N-­Out Burger, where we had met with a
              young Pakistani woman who had recently left Islam and was seeking
              advice on reconciling with members of her family. Her struggles struck
              some raw nerves with me, and my spirit was burdened as we drove
              through the gloom and returned to our hotel. But upon entering the
              hotel lobby, I saw the headlines on a TV and my heart sank even lower:
              A young American teacher had just been gunned down in Libya.
                  It was a local news station reporting that Ronnie Smith, a Texan,
              had been out for a morning jog when gunmen in a black jeep targeted
              and killed him. The news reported that Ronnie had graduated from
              the University of Texas with a master’s degree and was teaching chem-
              istry in Benghazi. At this, my ears pricked up. Benghazi was a highly
              unstable, war-­torn city where militias held more power than the govern-
              ment. Why would anyone go there to teach? I had a hunch, but I wanted
              to investigate and find out more.
                  Once I went online, my suspicions were confirmed. Ronnie Smith
              was a Christian who wanted to serve the Libyan people. He was a deacon
              at his church in Austin, and he took his faith seriously: Because Jesus
              was willing to die for those who sinned against him, Ronnie believed

                                                                                    93

           that following Jesus meant being willing to risk even his life to serve
           those who may even be his enemies. The gift that God had given him
           was to teach chemistry, so he decided to serve the Libyans as a teacher.
               Fully aware of the danger, he and his wife moved their family to
           Libya in the immediate aftermath of its revolution, while the country
           was still in disarray. They decided to stay even after the notorious attack
           on the American consulate by a group called “Servants of Sharia,” where
           the US ambassador, Christopher Stevens, and three others were killed.
           The Smiths stayed because they considered the lives of their neighbors
           and students more important than their safety.
               One of those students, Yomna Zentani, told reporters how Ronnie
           impacted her and other students. “After everything that happened in
           Libya, we were losing hope and he was the only one who was supporting
           us, motivating us, telling us that as long as we studied everything would
           be okay. He was the silver lining. He dedicated so much of his time for
           all his students. He chose to come here and help us, and to risk his life.”


           RONNIE’S MOTIVATION
           Even as I write this, tears are overwhelming me. I think of great men
           like Ronnie Smith and have to ask myself, How did Ronnie become
           like this? How did this man become so loving and self-­sacrificial that
           he was willing to move even his family into danger to serve those who
           could never give him anything in return? Thankfully, I do not have
           to wonder. It turns out that Ronnie, in his response to a survey a few
           years before his death, recommended a sermon by John Piper titled,
           “Doing Missions When Dying Is Gain.” About the sermon, Ronnie
           said, “Through sermons like these, God called me and my family to
           unreached peoples.”
               In that sermon, Piper impresses upon his congregation that Jesus
           “dies and he suffers for people all over the world in every nation.” His
           followers are called to do the same if they wish to truly follow him. “The
           love offering of Christ is to be presented in person through missionaries
           to the peoples for whom he died . . . a presentation to the nations of the
           sufferings of his cross through the sufferings of his people.” Christians




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 94                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                    Libya’s Best Friend   95

              ought to be ready to suffer alongside Jesus because their Lord suffered
              on the cross, and he intends for the entire world to be impacted by
              Christians following his model.
                  Quoting Hebrews 13:13 (NIV), “Let us, then, go to him outside the
              camp, bearing the disgrace he bore,” Piper spends over half his sermon
              explaining that Christians who are called to follow Jesus have to be
              ready to suffer for the sake of the world. He shares stories of martyr
              after martyr who followed Jesus in reaching the world with his love.
              While studying the sermon, one example took my breath away in light
              of Ronnie’s death: Piper spoke of Raymond Lull, a Christian who trave-
              led to North Africa knowing he could be martyred for proclaiming the
              gospel to Muslims. As soon as Lull started preaching in Algeria, he was
              stoned to death. To this, Piper said, “What a way to go!”
                  This is the teaching that motivated Ronnie Smith and made him
              into the great man who served Libyans unto death: Jesus intends for
              us to follow him by reaching the world with his love, even if it kills us.
              When we consider the message of the gospel, all the pieces fall in place.
              God did not just tell us to love sacrificially; he is our Lord and exemplar,
              and so he first did it for us.
                  The Creator of the universe, God, surrounded by angels and wor-
              shiped in unimaginable glory, was willing to lower himself into this
              world and suffer for people so they could be saved and know his love.
              If he is the example for Christians, then Christians must be willing to
              leave any comfort and go anywhere so that people can know God’s love
              and be saved.
                  God was willing to suffer for people who sinned against him, people
              who used the hands he gave them to crucify him. Not only did he tell
              his followers, “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you”
              (Matt. 5:44 NIV), he exemplified it. If he is the example for Christians,
              then Christians must be willing to self-­sacrificially serve even their ene-
              mies, knowing full well that they may be killed for it.
                  The reason why Christians can follow Jesus boldly into death is
              because we are not worried about trying to save ourselves. The gos-
              pel is that God has already promised us salvation through his infinite
              mercy and grace. This is the synergy of Christian teaching: Christians




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 95                                                   7/1/16 1:57 PM

           96   Muhammad or Jesus?

           can follow Jesus and die for their enemies because the gospel promises
           and enacts salvation, taking away all fear of death. This frees us to love
           everyone, friend and foe, enabling us to live according to the image in
           which we were made, the image of a God who is love in his very essence.
               Combining these insights with what we learned in the previous two
           parts of the book, the gospel calls us to live and love without holding
           back, according to the image of the triune God in which we have been
           made, enabling us to follow Jesus, our Lord and perfect example, even
           in the face of death.


           THE LOVE OF CHRIST: A MEGAPHONE TO THE WORLD
           Ronnie Smith knew all this well, and when he left this world, he left it
           an example of a true Christian. What was most saddening as I read his
           story, though, was that few media outlets gave any clue as to Ronnie’s
           motivation for being in Libya. Here was a vessel of Christian love,
           and few were highlighting the source. But days later, the spotlight was
           wrenched onto the lavish love of Christ.
               One week after his murder, Ronnie’s wife Anita wrote an open letter
           to the men who killed him. Its message was so transcendent, so other-
           worldly, that it stunned the world. She did not mince words.

                To his attackers: I love you and I forgive you.
                     How could I not? For Jesus taught us to “Love our enemies”—­
                not to kill them or seek revenge. Jesus sacrificed his life out of love
                for the very people who killed him, as well as for us today. His death
                and resurrection opened the door for us to walk on the straight
                path to God in peace and forgiveness. Because of what Jesus did,
                Ronnie is with Jesus in paradise now. Jesus came not only to take
                us to paradise when we die but also to bring peace and healing on
                this earth. Ronnie loved you because God loves you. Ronnie loved
                you because God loved him—­not because Ronnie was so great, but
                because God is so great.1

                                                                   Libya’s Best Friend   97

                  Anita forgave the men who killed her husband. She forgave them
              because Jesus forgave us. She loves them because Jesus loves them.
                  Read that again: She said she loves them! She loves the men who
              ruthlessly took her best friend, who killed her husband of ten years, who
              left her infant son fatherless! How can she love those men? Shouldn’t
              she want to exact retribution? Shouldn’t she want to hunt them down
              and take from them what they took from her? This is a forgiveness and
              a love that makes no sense, that is unlike anything in this world. But as
              evidenced by the media’s response, it is a love that captivates the world.
                  Jesus and Muhammad led very different lives and were exemplars
              for their people in very different ways. The message of Islam is that
              Muhammad is the best man who ever lived on earth, but I think this
              world needs an example that is beyond this earth. It needs a heavenly
              solution, something that makes no sense from a natural perspective
              and yet leaves all who witness it with a deep sense of awe that this is
              the answer.
                  Ronnie’s death was the voice of a martyr testifying to the love of
              Christ, and Anita’s letter was his megaphone. This love can change
              the world.

                    THE BURNING OF SCRIPTURE


              I  n 2011, on the first day of April, twenty thousand demonstrators
                 gathered before the gates of a United Nations compound in Mazar-­
              e-­Sharif, a city long believed to be one of Afghanistan’s safest. Hastily
              scrawled signs carried by the throng bore clichéd reproaches: “Down
              with America” and “Death to Obama.” They were accorded little time
              to prepare novel slogans, as it was earlier that very day when worshipers
              had gathered at the local mosques for Friday prayers, that three imams
              sparked and stoked a flame among the crowds with one singular intent:
              Bring Americans to justice.
                   The people responded en masse, choosing the UN compound to
              demonstrate their unrest. Very quickly the demonstration became a
              protest, and the protest became a mob. Afghan National Police did not
              control the crowd, refusing assistance from a NATO-­led security force.
              The task of defending the compound fell to the UN guards. As the crowds
              swelled and their confidence in numbers grew, some of the more zealous
              protesters began rioting and stoning the UN building. The guards proved
              powerless, and the situation rapidly devolved: Rioters overran the guard
              towers, toppling them to the ground. Wresting guns from the guards,
              they first began to beat the guards, then started shooting them. After
              killing four, they set fire to the compound and began hunting foreigners.
              The riot did not disperse until Westerners lay beheaded.
                   Among the slain were two Scandinavians: the first female pilot in
              Norwegian military history and a Swedish human rights scholar who
              had arrived in Afghanistan scarcely a month earlier. Additional casu-
              alties included the four guards, all of whom were Nepalese Gurkhas; a
              Romanian specialist in political affairs; and five Afghan rioters.

                                                                                    101

           102    The Quran or the Bible?

                The loss of twelve lives is tragic, especially when we consider that
           the UN is a humanitarian organization and that those who join it often
           do so for the sake of aiding in foreign crises. But what takes this event
           beyond tragedy is just how nonsensical the violence was. The mob
           demanded justice from Americans, but instead they slaughtered innocent
           Europeans and Asians. What happened? Why did they attack the UN?
                The year before, an obscure political activist and pastor from
           Florida announced his plans to burn the Quran “for its crimes against
           humanity” on the ninth anniversary of September 11. He became an
           international pariah overnight. Many in the media and government
           urged him to reconsider, as burning the Quran could lead to American
           casualties abroad. Under pressure from the White House, the activist
           asserted that, though he was not convinced, he was considering their
           words and planned to dialogue with key imams. September 11 thus
           came and went, and he did not burn the Quran. The media spotlight
           left him, the situation dissipated, and all went silent.
                But off camera, the dialogues failed. Six months later, when virtually
           no one was watching, he moved forward with his plans. He held a mock
           trial, condemned the Quran on charges of violence and oppression, and
           executed judgment by burning it. The video would have remained in
           obscurity, like dozens of other Quran burning videos before it, except
           that media outlets broadcasted the video globally. Government officials,
           in turn, widely publicized their condemnations. As one news source
           reports, it was through Hamid Karzai’s denouncement of the burning
           that most Afghans learned about it. In response to the news from the
           Afghan president, the firebrand mullahs of Mazar-­e-­Sharif incited ram-
           page and slaughter.
                The series of events is so tragic that it is easy to overlook the absurdity
           of it all. In response to the activist’s claim that Islam causes oppression
           and violence, Afghan imams demanded he be silenced and precipitated
           the slaughter of innocents. The media, reveling in their denouncement
           of the activist’s life-­risking behavior, put the limelight on him, thereby
           themselves catalyzing the murderous reaction from the East. The riot-
           ers of Mazar-­e-­Sharif, unable to discern between Westerners, took the
           lives of innocent Europeans. They stereotypically proclaimed death to




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 102                                                     7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                              The Burning of Scripture   103

              Obama, the American president who has been most vocal in his support
              of Islam, having said, “I consider it part of my responsibility as President
              of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wher-
              ever they appear.” Of course, even having to comment on the relation of
              Gurkhas to this debacle leaves us shaking our heads.
                  But let us now take note of the principal matter: Throughout the
              series of events, no one doubted that burning the Quran would lead to
              riot and murder. This was such a firm fact that no one even suggested
              otherwise. Not the activist, not the media, not the government, and not
              even Muslim leaders. Everyone knew that the offense of burning the
              Quran would lead to violence.
                  We ought to contrast this to a similar event, close in both time and
              proximity. In 2009, at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, the US govern-
              ment announced that it burned dozens of Bibles. A military official
              provided the illuminating reason: The Bibles were trash, and the mili-
              tary burns its trash.
                  This bears repeating. The US government officially announced that
              the Bibles were trash, and accordingly they were burned. I do not repeat
              this to evoke sentiment, but to provide contrast: In this instance, there
              was not the remotest concern that any Christians would go into a mur-
              derous rampage because the government burned Bibles.
                  To further clarify the matter, let’s consider how the Bible burning
              came to light. The Christian soldier from whom the Bibles were confis-
              cated did not publicly complain, nor did the church that sent them stir
              an outcry, even though the military ought to have simply sent the Bibles
              back to the church instead of burning them.
                  The announcement from the military was yet another attempt to
              appease Afghan Muslims. A news outlet had recently aired a video that
              showed soldiers at a Christian chapel service, and military officials
              feared that this would cause local Muslims to think that the military
              was there to evangelize. To quell their anger, imagined though that
              anger might have been, the military announced that they had been
              burning Bibles. They emphasized that they were so committed to not
              offending Muslims that they chose to burn Bibles rather than return
              them, on the off chance that the church would try to send them again.

           104    The Quran or the Bible?

              Let us take note again of the principal matter: Throughout all the
           reports and government decisions, no one believed that burning the
           Bibles would lead to riot or murder. This was such a firm fact that no
           one suggested otherwise. Not the soldier, not the media, not the govern-
           ment, and not even church leaders. Everyone knew that the offense of
           burning the Bible would not lead to violence.


           THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE QURAN AND THE BIBLE
           Why? Why is it so obvious that burning a Quran in Florida will endan-
           ger lives halfway around the world, even if perpetrated by an obscure
           activist? Why is it so obvious that burning dozens of Bibles and calling
           them “trash” will not provoke any reaction of the sort, even if perpe-
           trated by a government?
               I am not arguing that Afghan Muslims are uneducated and tem-
           peramental, easily provoked to mindless rage; nor am I suggesting that
           Christians are either too indifferent or too docile to be passionate about
           their Holy Scripture. These are both caricatures that miss valuable insight.
               I believe the answer lies, at least partly, in the fact that the Quran has
           a different place in the hearts and minds of Muslims than the Bible does
           in the hearts and minds of Christians. Both scriptures are considered
           holy to their people, certainly, but their uses are different, their histories
           are different, and indeed, their very natures are understood differently.

                          COMPARING THE QURAN
                             AND THE BIBLE


              W       hen the Quran burning controversy was at full bore, my minis-
                      try partner and I decided to publish our official position on the
              matter: We certainly endorsed free speech, but we resolved that burning
              the Quran was a poor idea. Apart from being unnecessarily inflamma-
              tory, we felt it would be a more productive use of free speech to discuss
              the teachings of the Quran rather than to burn its pages.
                  But I had an additional reason for not endorsing the action: The
              place the Quran holds in the heart of Muslims is beyond the estimation
              of most Westerners, and so is the offense of burning it. There is nothing
              flammable on earth that Christians revere as much as Muslims revere the
              Quran. That is not to say that Christians do not highly revere the Bible,
              because they certainly do. But the traditional Muslim reverence for the
              Quran is almost inestimable. To understand this, we have to remember
              a point from the previous two chapters: The Quran is, to Muslims, the
              eternal Word of Allah himself. It is the closest thing to God incarnate.
              To Christians, the eternal Word of Yahweh is Jesus. The Quran holds
              in Islam the place that Jesus holds in the Christian faith. So let’s put it
              together: To comprehend the insult of burning a Quran, a Christian
              would have to imagine someone burning Jesus.1
                  Truly, burning a Bible is offensive, but not that offensive. Christians
              simply do not see the Bible as an eternal expression of the triune
              God. Christians believe that God inspired men to write exactly what
              he wanted them to write at specific times in history. Thus Christians
              believe that the Bible is inspired by God but not eternal. Once we begin

                                                                                     105




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 105                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

           106    The Quran or the Bible?

           to understand this fundamental difference, we will begin to understand
           much more.
               Since Muslims believe the Quran is an eternal expression of Allah,
           they do not think that the Quran was written by men in any sense. It
           is the very speech of Allah, inscribed on a heavenly tablet, from which
           it was read by Gabriel and dictated to Muhammad. It is not inspired
           in the Christian sense of inspiration, but rather it is revealed: Allah
           revealed it piecemeal to Muhammad, dictating it through the angel
           Gabriel. Muhammad had nothing to do with shaping the text; he only
           relayed it.
               This is why, as a young American Muslim child who spoke Urdu with
           his Pakistani parents at home and English with his friends at school, I
           was taught that Arabic was literally the language of heaven and the best
           of all languages. So adamant was my mother about teaching me to recite
           Arabic that I had recited the entire Quran in Arabic by the age of five,
           before I had learned to read English or Urdu. My mother was serious
           about the traditional Islamic insight: If the eternal speech of Allah was
           written in Arabic, then Arabic had to be Allah’s preferred language.
               This reverence for Arabic underlies many Muslim practices. It is
           why Muslims recite prayers in Arabic, even if they have yet to learn
           the meaning of the words they recite; it is why Muslims are hesitant
           to call non-­A rabic versions of the Quran “translations,” believing that
           there is mystical value and hidden meaning in the Arabic that cannot
           be translated; it is why some Muslims look for mathematical patterns
           in the Quran as proof of divine authorship; it is also why Muslims are
           confident that the Quran is inimitable in its literary excellence, as Allah
           himself generated it in the language of heaven.
               Christians, on the other hand, are more than willing to translate
           the Bible from its ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek into modern
           languages. Of course, it is always best to read something in its original
           language, because the original language may carry subtleties that do
           not translate easily, especially when translating from more nuanced
           languages like ancient Greek into less precise tongues like English or the
           Semitic languages. This is why scholars and students of the Bible prefer
           to read it in its original languages. But if someone reads a translation,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 106                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                   Comparing the Quran and the Bible   107

              Christians do not assume that some deep mystical value is lost, only
              exegetical implications that can be explained through study Bibles and
              commentaries.
                  By grasping the different natures of the books in the eyes of Muslims
              and Christians, we begin to understand the differences between the
              Quran and the Bible: The Islamic view of the eternality of the Quran
              affects the place it holds in Muslims’ hearts, something that finds a
              Christian analogue not in the Bible but in Jesus himself.


              THE COMPOSITION OF SCRIPTURE
              Each religion’s view of the nature of its scripture is closely connected to
              the history of its composition.
                  Since the Quran is eternal, it was not composed at a specific time.
              Rather, it was revealed piecemeal to mankind over twenty-­three years
              through Muhammad. It is reported that when someone asked a ques-
              tion of Muhammad, or when he faced certain problems, he would start
              perspiring and a recitation would come to him. The Syriac word for
              “recitation” is quran, and Muhammad would pass this quran on to
              his followers, usually in small packets of verses. Muslims would then
              recite these passages in their prayers, committing them to memory.
              All these recitations were ultimately collected in a book and arranged
              in 114 suras. A sura can contain verses next to one another that were
              revealed two decades apart. There may be any number of reasons for its
              present arrangement, but from what is obviously discernible, the Quran
              can be described as having its longer suras toward the beginning and
              shorter suras toward the end. In addition, Muslim scholars have made
              attempts to discern which suras of the Quran reflect revelations given to
              Muhammad during the first portion of his prophethood, called Meccan
              passages, and those given during the latter portion of his prophethood,
              called Medinan passages.
                  By contrast, Christians have traditionally taught that God inspired
              specific men in history to write his words, using their experiences and
              their language to convey his message. God masterfully used the speech
              of chosen men to convey exactly what he desired and has preserved that

           108    The Quran or the Bible?

           message through the millennia. The result is the Bible, a collection of
           sixty-­six books written by about forty people over fifteen hundred years.
           The first thirty-­nine books are called the Old Testament, and the final
           twenty-­seven are called the New Testament. Testament is roughly a syn-
           onym for covenant, so the Old Testament was written during the time
           of God’s covenant with Moses, whereas the New Testament was written
           after God came to earth, upon the advent of the new covenant initiated
           by Jesus and prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31–33.


           THE CONTENTS OF SCRIPTURE
           Since Muslims believe the Quran was revealed via dictation to one per-
           son, it makes sense that it contains essentially only one genre and one
           perspective: Allah speaking to Muhammad. Although there are signif-
           icant exceptions, such as the first chapter, which is the speech of men,
           the Quran more or less reads in the same manner throughout its text.
                On the other hand, since the Bible was written by so many people
           over so many years, it makes sense that there are many genres and
           perspectives. The Old Testament is often divided into three sections:
           the Law (Hebrew: Torah), the Prophets (Navi’ im), and the Writings
           (Ketuvim). The Jews refer to the text using an acronym for these three
           Hebrew words: Tanakh, asserting the diversity of the Scriptures. As
           examples, long sections of ceremonial law can be found in the Torah,
           whole books of history are found in the Prophets, and Hebrew poetry is
           found in the Writings. When we look to the New Testament, we see that
           it is divided into five historical books, twenty-­one letters, and a book of
           apocalyptic prophecy. Unlike the Quran, the Bible is very diverse in its
           literary genres and perspectives.
                Seeing the New Testament as an addition to the Tanakh might help
           Christians understand how Muslims see the Quran. It is the final reve-
           lation confirming that which was before it—­“the Newest Testament,” in
           a sense. The Quran asserts that the Torah is actually inspired scripture,
           as is the gospel (5.68), but that the Quran has now come as the final
           scripture to guide mankind.

              THE ORAL OR WRITTEN MODALITIES OF SCRIPTURE
              It is also important to note the difference between written texts and
              oral texts. To understand this, consider the difference between writing
              a letter and having a transcript of a telephone conversation. Although it
              might be the same person communicating the same ideas, the mode in
              which he would write is very different from the mode in which he would
              speak, primarily because people have more time to consider what to say
              when writing and more time to consider what has been said when read-
              ing. For these reasons, written communication is more thorough and
              less repetitive than oral communication, along with a host of attendant
              corollary characteristics.
                   Since Muslims teach that the Quran was dictated from Allah
              through Gabriel to Muhammad, and that Muhammad then relayed it
              orally to his scribes, it makes sense that the Quran is primarily an oral
              text. Not only is it mostly used in an oral manner, recited aloud in
              prayer for people to hear and memorize, but also it reads like a transcript
              of spoken communication. For example, instead of sharing full stories,
              Allah usually says, “Remember the time when . . .” and begins in the
              middle of a story, assuming the hearer has already heard the story else-
              where. Otherwise he will start at the beginning and stop in the middle
              of a story. This is why devout Muslims are often able to refer to names
              of prophets but not to full life stories. Because of its oral modality, there
              are almost no full stories in the Quran, with the notable exception of
              the story of Joseph.
                   The Bible, on the other hand, is composed of mostly written
              texts.2 Stories and records are linear and complete. This is why devout
              Christians are able to share birth-­to-­death accounts of not just Joseph
              but dozens of people: Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon, John the Baptist,
              and Jesus, among many others.


              ABROGATION AND THE FINAL FORM OF SCRIPTURE
              Grasping the orality of the Quran helps with understanding the contro-
              versial phenomenon of abrogation. While Muhammad was still alive,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 109                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           110    The Quran or the Bible?

           he would give recitations that cancelled previous ones. In other words,
           he would tell his followers that certain portions of the Quran he had
           relayed before were no longer to be recited as part of the Quran. This
           was met with resistance, as people asked him how the Word of God
           could be cancelled. The response is recorded in 2.106 of the Quran,
           which asserts that Allah can substitute verses in his divine scripture
           because “he has power over all things.”3
               People accustomed to written texts might balk at the concept of
           abrogation; how can God command removing portions of his eternal
           word? But Quranic abrogation makes much more sense when we recall
           that the Quran was primarily oral. People were not expected to tear
           out pages from their Qurans or take a red pen to certain verses and
           strike them out. Rather, they were expected to simply stop reciting those
           passages in prayer, and thereby to forget them.
               Although Muhammad’s revelations were considered inspired texts
           as he relayed them, which was well before the Quran’s final form, the
           Bible’s books were finalized before the church recognized them as
           scripture. At that point, there was no room for abrogating portions.
           Therefore, having a different modality and different history, the Bible
           never underwent any abrogation.


           THE SUFFICIENCY OF SCRIPTURE
           Not all abrogated verses were left out of the text of the Quran, though.
           Muslim scholars have classically taught that there are multiple types of
           abrogation, including abrogation of text-­not-­law and abrogation of law-­
           not-­text. In other words, they teach that Allah intended certain verses to be
           recited but not practiced, and other verses to be practiced but not recited.
           For these reasons, Muslims scholars turn to the records of Muhammad’s
           life, the hadith, for clarification. In addition, as we have already seen, most
           Islamic practices actually come from hadith and not from the Quran.
                This is why Muslims do not believe the Quran is sufficient for Islamic
           practice, but it requires authoritative hadith. Very few Muslims believe
           in the sufficiency of the Quran, and these “Quran only” Muslims are
           often deemed heretical by mainstream Muslims.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 110                                                    7/1/16 1:57 PM

                  The Bible, on the other hand, requires no complementary texts to
              decipher its teachings or provide supplementary Christian practices. It is
              sufficient and serves as the sole authority for Christian doctrine.4


              THE EXEGESIS OF SCRIPTURE
              The abrogation of the Quran, its piecemeal nature, and its heavy reli-
              ance upon hadith have traditionally been part of the reason why the
              average Muslim does not engage in Quranic exegesis. What if the verse
              they are reading has been abrogated and no longer applies? What if
              the context of a verse is not clear, since the verses before it or after it
              could be from completely different occasions? Besides, the Quran is in
              classical Arabic, a language no one speaks natively any longer. For these
              reasons and others, Muslims generally defer to scholars and imams for
              the explanation of verses and texts. That is why the vast majority of
              Muslims do not directly use the Quran themselves for anything but
              liturgy: memorization and recitation for prayers.
                   The Bible, on account of its written modality, sufficiency, and trans-
              latability, is accessible enough for the average literate Christian to read it
              directly and learn from it. One does not need to be a scholar to interpret
              what the Bible says. Of course, knowing more context is helpful, and the
              insights of scholars and theologians are valuable, but the nature of the
              biblical text allows devout Christians to go to it directly and learn from
              it, and so they do.


              THE EPISTEMIC PURPOSE OF SCRIPTURE
              Muslims believe that the Quran primarily serves as a guidance for man-
              kind, of course, but since they do not usually exegete it themselves it
              is fair to classify this as an indirect purpose for the average Muslim.
              Rather, it is the mystical value of the Quran that serves as its primary
              purpose. This is illustrated by devout Muslims’ average encounter with
              the Quran: its recitation in Arabic, even if the Muslim does not speak
              Arabic. In this case, it is not guidance but blessings that Muslims seek.
                  So great is the traditional Muslim’s confidence in the mystical value




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 111                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

           112    The Quran or the Bible?

           of the Quran that it serves as the primary proof of Islam’s veracity;
           Muslims are confident Islam is true because the Quran is so perfect.
           This epistemic use of the Quran traditionally goes back to Muhammad
           himself, who pointed to the Quran as the validation for his claim to
           prophethood. “How could any man produce such a perfect book? It
           must be from God.” So the primary use of the Quran is to serve as the
           basis of why Muslims believe in Islam.
                On the other hand, as we have seen, the Bible is intelligible to the
           average Christian who can access it in one’s own language and exegete
           it for oneself. Of course, there are some who use the Bible for mystical
           purposes, but that is not its traditional or primary use. Similarly, there
           are some who believe in the Christian message because of the Bible, but
           it is usually not the reason why people are Christian. Unlike the Quran,
           the primary use of the Bible is to serve as the basis of what Christians
           believe, not why they believe.
                And so, in discussing the differences between the Quran and the
           Bible, we have come full circle. The primary purpose of each scripture
           is related to its nature: The Quran is valuable in its mystical tran-
           scendence, while the Bible is valuable in its translatable and accessible
           guidance. There are many other ways in which the Quran and the Bible
           differ from one another, but the ones we have just covered will give us
           the needed insight into common disagreements and misunderstandings
           between Muslims and Christians over scripture.

                               QUESTIONING TEXTS


              A     t the end of the twentieth century, one name dominated Muslim-­
                    Christian dialogue: Ahmed Deedat. Born in India in 1918, Deedat
              immigrated to South Africa at a young age and started his adult life
              making ends meet as a furniture salesman. In that multicultural environ-
              ment, Deedat encountered evangelists who challenged him to consider
              the gospel, and he started studying Islamic apologetics in response. By
              his midtwenties he was teaching apologetic lectures of his own, and for
              the next forty years he devoted his life to promoting Islam, printing
              booklets, and even establishing an Islamic seminary. Despite the support
              of his friends and some significant donations, most of his early work was
              unsuccessful.
                  But everything changed for Deedat in the 1980s when he started
              debating well-­ k nown Christians like Josh McDowell and Jimmy
              Swaggart. He presented challenges from a nuanced Islamic perspective
              that were uncommon to those accustomed to dialogue with skeptics
              and the irreligious. The novelty of his arguments combined with his
              sharp rhetoric often made it appear he had bested his opponents. His
              fame skyrocketed virtually overnight, and he was received with honor
              by presidents of Muslim nations and received rewards for his service
              to Islam.
                  Along with Deedat’s fame grew his inflammatory rhetoric. As a
              response to the pope’s positive stance toward interfaith dialogue, Deedat
              challenged John Paul II to a debate. When the pope refused, Deedat
              published a pamphlet titled “His Holiness Plays Hide and Seek with
              Muslims.” He also famously began to argue that the Bible was por-
              nographic. Further inflammatory speech during a Good Friday lecture

                                                                                   113

           in Sydney earned him the castigation of the Australian government, and
           he was even banned from entry into Singapore.
               In 1996, at the height of his career, Deedat suffered a severe stroke.
           Among other neurological deficiencies, Deedat was no longer able to
           speak, and he remained bedridden until his passing in 2005. Some
           suggested that God had punished him for his words, and other ru-
           mors spread that Deedat had repudiated Islam just before his passing.
           Within the Islamic world, though, both these suggestions are resolutely
           dismissed. Deedat’s fame continues to grow, even after his death, into
           legendary status. His rhetorically charged style of argumentation has
           been picked up by the present face of Islamic apologetics, Zakir Naik,
           who has a following of millions of Muslims around the world.
               The technique that Naik employs, the one that Deedat mastered
           and that many Muslims use on account of him today, is to challenge
           the Bible while proclaiming that the Quran is unassailable. Most com-
           monly, they charge the Bible to be full of contradictions, whereas they
           assert that the Quran has none.


           SCRIPTURE AND CONTRADICTIONS
           There is much to be said about this challenge. In essence, Christians agree
           that inerrant, inspired scripture will not contradict itself. But now that we
           have discussed the differences between the Quran and the Bible, it might
           be more clear why this is such a staple of Muslim-­Christian dialogue.
               First, the Quran is written in one uniform style, whereas the Bible is
           written in many genres. When someone accustomed to only one mode
           of speaking comes across texts like “God is love” in 1 John and “God
           hated Esau” in the Psalms, they often forget to consider the genres.
               Ranging from history to law to poetry and even a record of the loving
           relationship of Solomon and his bride, the Bible is a collection of very
           diverse books, and we ought not read all the books in the same way. The
           genre of a book affects the way we interpret it. For example, one should
           not read the book of Psalms in the same way as the book of Romans; the
           former is a book of poetry and should be read as a sanctified expression of
           the heart, whereas the latter is an epistle that explores Christian doctrine




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 114                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                     Questioning Texts   115

              and should be among the first foundations of a systematic theology.
              Another example of poor exegesis would be reading the gospel of John
              in the same manner as the book of Revelation. Even though they are
              written by the same author, their genres are very different: The gospel
              of John is historical and biographic, whereas the book of Revelation is a
              book of apocalypse, and intends to be understood in prophetic terms. So
              although we can be quite confident that Jesus literally walked in Galilee
              (e.g., John 1:43), it is poor exegesis to read about a dragon sweeping
              away the stars in the same literal way (Rev. 12:4)! Understanding genre
              is an essential part of interpreting Scripture, yet Muslim apologists often
              raise the challenge of contradiction without taking genre into account.
                  Second, the Quran serves as the basis for Muslim confidence in their
              religion; it is the “why” of Islamic faith. Muslims understand that the
              Quran is the keystone of Islam’s truth, and they assume the same for the
              Bible. But the Bible is not the “why” of Christian faith; it is the “what.”
              The “why” of the Christian faith is the life, death, and resurrection
              of Jesus. So Muslim apologists direct much dialogue toward Christian
              Scripture, assuming it ought to have the same impact as a challenge to
              the Quran would, though that is not the case.
                  I was guilty of this mistake myself when I was a Muslim. In 2002,
              I sent an email to my friend David with dozens of alleged Bible contra-
              dictions, and he responded. We went back and forth for months. What
              I ultimately realized then, and am more confident of now, is that allega-
              tions of contradictions often reflect more about a reader than the text.
                  There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting apparent
              inconsistencies in a text. On the one hand, a reader can deem every
              inconsistency a contradiction; on the other, a reader can attempt to
              harmonize the differences and try to make exceptions for the apparent
              inconsistencies. If a reader is friendly toward a text, he or she will give it
              the benefit of the doubt and harmonize it, whereas if a reader is antag-
              onistic, he or she will discredit the text as contradictory. This is almost
              always what happens when Muslims and Christians lodge accusations
              of contradictions against one another.
                  On that note, Christians often do accuse the Quran of having contra-
              dictions. One website, for example, charges the Quran with containing

           116    The Quran or the Bible?

           over 120 contradictions.1 Some examples: 6.163 says Muhammad was the
           first believer, 7.143 says Moses was the first, and 26.40 says that Pharaoh’s
           magicians were; 88.6 teaches that the only food in hell will be thorns,
           whereas 69.36 says it will be pus, and 37.66 says it will be devil-­like fruit;
           7.54, 10.3, 11.7, and 25.29 teach that Allah created the world in six days,
           whereas 41.9–12 gives a total of eight days; 2.29 says Allah created the
           earth before the heavens, and 79.30 says he created the heavens before the
           earth; 96.2 says Allah created man from blood, 25.54 says from water,
           15.26 says from clay, and 30.20 says from dust; 109.1–6 says non-­Muslims
           worship different gods, whereas 2.139 says Jews and Christians worship
           the same God as Muslims; 4.48 says Allah does not forgive idolatry, and
           4.153 shows him forgiving idolatry; 4.78 says all blessings and afflictions
           are from Allah, whereas 4.79, the very next verse, says blessings are from
           Allah and afflictions are brought on by those who suffer them. These are
           but a few of hundreds of alleged Quran contradictions.
                Even though Quran contradictions are far more devastating to the
           case for Islam than Bible contradictions are to the case for Christianity,
           I find these arguments about contradictions to be unproductive and
           bordering on fatuous. I prefer the constructive dialogue of giving each
           text the benefit of the doubt and discussing the merits of what they are
           asserting, rather than reading the texts inimically and accusing them of
           contradictions wherever possible.


           HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS VERSE?
           Along the same lines of genre and exegesis, Christians often approach
           their Muslim friends and ask them how they interpret certain passages
           of the Quran. For example, Muslims in the West often say that Islam is
           a religion of peace, to which Christians ask how they handle verses like
           9.111, which says: “Allah has bought your life and your property for this,
           that you may slay and be slain.” Muslims will often respond at this point
           that they are not sure how to handle it, but that does not change their
           minds about Islam being a religion of peace.
               Christians may be frustrated by pointing to the apparent meaning
           of a verse to no effect, but they should remember that Muslims do not




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 116                                                    7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                    Questioning Texts   117

              generally exegete the Quran themselves; and by asking for an interpreta-
              tion of a verse, they may very well be asking a Muslim to do something
              they have never done before. Muslims receive such guidance and inter-
              pretations from their imams, and a Christian should not be surprised to
              hear the retort, “Don’t ask me, I’m not a scholar!”
                  What might be more helpful for a Christian who wants to point
              out such verses in the Quran to a Muslim friend is to find a scholar in
              that Muslim’s line of authority, and see if that scholar’s interpretation
              says the same thing. If it does, present the verse along with the scholar’s
              judgment and continue the conversation from there.


              THE BIBLE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED
              Finally, we turn to the most common Muslim accusation against the
              Bible: that its text has been changed over time. It should also be clear
              now why Muslims accuse the Bible of having been altered: because the
              Quran says it teaches the same thing as the Bible, confirming the Torah
              and the gospel, yet the teachings of the Bible are clearly different. In the
              same vein, the Quran teaches that Muhammad was prophesied in the
              Bible, but there appears to be no such prophecy.2
                  Interpreting what the Quran says about the Bible is controversial
              business. There are a few texts in the Quran that Muslims take to teach
              that the Bible has been changed, but closer investigation seems to reveal
              that these verses actually teach that Christians and Jews abandon their
              teachings for falsehood—­not that the words of their Scriptures have
              themselves been corrupted. The overall meaning of the Quran seems
              straightforward: Jews and Christians still had their holy texts at the
              time of Muhammad, and they could follow the straight path by reading
              them. Regardless, Muslims very commonly accuse the Bible of signifi-
              cant alteration.
                  When lodging this criticism, a small minority of Muslims are
              envisioning insignificant biblical alterations that they perceive to be
              significant. To understand this, we again have to see through an Islamic
              lens. Muslims believe the Quran has to be perfectly preserved right down
              to the very letter because of the Quran’s mystical nature. But an altered




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 117                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           118    The Quran or the Bible?

           letter is not a problem for Christians, because Christians are concerned
           with the preservation of the meaning of the Bible, and the same thing
           can be said in multiple ways in Greek without changing the meaning.
           For example, the words “Jesus loves Peter” can be written sixteen ways
           in Greek. The letters could be altered in sixteen different ways without
           affecting the meaning whatsoever. So this kind of accusation might be
           true, but it is insignificant from the Christian perspective.
                What most Muslims envision when they say the Bible has been cor-
           rupted, though, are wholesale omissions or insertions of New Testament
           teachings, intentional alterations by ruling powers. This sort of corruption
           of the biblical text simply never happened, nor could it have happened.
                As an example, let us consider the book of the Bible called 1 Peter.
           When the disciple Peter wrote this letter, he sent it to its recipients.
           They made copies of it and sent the copies to other churches in other
           cities. Those churches made copies of it and sent them out to yet other
           churches. Now let’s imagine that the church to which Peter sent it made
           five copies, and each church they sent a copy to made five more copies.
           Even at this early stage in the life of the letter, there are thirty-­one extant
           copies. If someone wanted to effectively alter the text, they would have
           to recall all thirty-­one copies. But nobody had the ability to do that.
           Nobody had ruling power over all of Christendom until the fourth cen-
           tury, three hundred years after Jesus. By that time, there were thousands
           of copies of the biblical texts, and even someone with authority over
           them would not have the practical ability to collect them all.
                Even if someone had the capacity to recall all the texts and edit them,
           there would certainly have been some record of such a massive recall. It
           is virtually impossible to envision every Christian calmly handing over
           sacred texts to be altered without some trace of resistance or complaint.
                So the only way the Bible could have been corrupted on such a grand
           scale is if someone early in Christian history had the authority and the
           power to recall all the texts, destroy them, and issue official copies,
           resulting in complaints and resistance. Yet no such person or record of
           events has ever existed. Interestingly, such a person and such a record do
           exist in the early history of the Quran.

                                            Chapter 16



                               THE FIRST BURNING
                                 OF THE QURAN


              M       uhammad’s third successor, the Caliph Uthman, had author-
                      ity over the entire Muslim ummah from approximately AD
              644–655. Already by his time, variant recitations of the Quran were
              causing dissension among Muslims, and Uthman decided he had to do
              something before the hostilities spread.
                  Within about twenty years after Muhammad’s death, the leader of
              the Islamic Empire recalled all Quranic manuscripts, destroyed them
              by fire, and issued official, standardized copies. When this happened,
              devout companions of Muhammad strongly resisted the recall of their
              texts, and the records of their dissent remain with us today.
                  So the Bible could not have been altered because there was no central
              control over it in early Christian history, and as such it was never recalled
              or edited. But there certainly was such control over the Quran in early
              Muslim history, and there was an exact time when it was recalled and
              edited. Islamic history makes no attempt to hide the official burning
              of all Qurans and the propagation of its officially standardized version.
                  Apart from ignorance or bias, I am not sure how anyone can con-
              tinue to accuse the Bible of corruption when the Quran would stand
              condemned under consistent scrutiny. Indeed, the history of the Quran
              was one of the factors that stopped me from accusing the Bible of cor-
              ruption when I was a Muslim. On account of Uthman’s control over
              the Quran, there simply is no basis to accuse the Bible of large-­scale
              corruption without condemning the Quran.

           120    The Quran or the Bible?


           THE DIVERSITY OF SCRIPTURE
           In addition to its more pristine textual history, the diversity of the Bible
           is a strength. It reflects God’s love for diversity. One language is not
           superior, one people are not superior, one mode of writing is not supe-
           rior. Rather, God intends for humans to learn from history books, from
           law, from poetry, from proverbs, from apocalyptic literature, and more.
           He can teach through a fisherman like Peter, through a theologian like
           Paul, through a statesman like Moses, through a queen like Esther, and
           through his own incarnation. There is beauty and power in diversity,
           and the Bible reflects that.
               More to the point of trustworthiness, in order to accept the Quran,
           one has to first accept Muhammad, as he is the only one who received
           Quranic revelations from Gabriel. On the other hand, whole commu-
           nities testified to the inspiration of the biblical Scriptures, and they did
           not come from the mouth of one person.1


           THE BIBLE SPEAKS TO THE HEART OF MAN
           As a Muslim, even though I had plenty of evidence to trust the Bible
           and had learned about Uthman’s recension of the Quran, the ultimate
           tipping point for me came when I asked God himself to lead me. At
           the end of my rope, completely distraught and emptied of tears, I asked
           God, whether Allah or Jesus, to guide me through his Scripture. I
           needed his comfort, and I was turning to him.
               I started by opening the Quran. This was my first time opening
           the Quran for personal guidance instead of simply reciting memorized
           portions of it or asking an imam for help. As I looked through its pages,
           I realized there was not a single verse in it designed to comfort me while
           I was hurting. Although there were certainly verses that promised Allah
           would reward me for doing the right thing, there was nothing that
           said Allah loves me for who I am or that sought to comfort me despite
           my failures.
               The Bible, on the other hand, was overflowing with the comfort
           of God and his love for me. God spoke to me through Matthew 5:4,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 120                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                      The First Burning of the Quran   121

              which says, “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted”
              (NIV). Here there is no condition, no requirement of performance; God
              comforts those who are mourning. Verse 6 amplified this: “Blessed are
              those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled”
              (NIV). Not blessed are the righteous, but blessed are those who hunger
              and thirst for righteousness. As if written for someone like me, some-
              one hurting and just reaching out to God, the Bible spoke to me of
              God’s love.
                  It spoke to me. Not to Muhammad, not to seventh-­century speakers
              of Arabic, but to me. And that is the power of God’s Word—­it traverses
              the ages and resonates with all his people. There is no word like the
              Word of God.

                               THE FIRST CRUSADE


              I  n Clermont, France, on November 27, AD 1095, Pope Urban II issued
                 the First Crusade. He goaded Christians into traveling from Western
              Europe to the Middle East, where Muslims had lived for over 450 years,
              in order to fight against the “infidels” and “barbarians,” “an accursed
              race wholly alienated from God.” He urged not only knights but even
              mercenaries and robbers to “obtain the eternal reward” by joining in the
              effort “to destroy that vile race from the lands.”1 Many were moved by
              the pope’s call to arms, and Europeans soon departed to carry the cross
              eastward into battle.
                  In the spring of 1096, an army of crusaders advanced through the
              Rhineland led by Count Emicho, where it was believed that Jewish
              moneylenders kept hoards of wealth. Emicho’s army went from city to
              city slaughtering innocent Jews as “enemies of Christ,” plundering their
              wealth to finance the Crusade. His army killed thousands of Jews and
              forced others to convert or face the same fate.
                  As the crusaders continued toward the Holy Land, their attacks
              against various cities delayed their arrival to Jerusalem until June 1099.
              After a few days’ siege, the crusaders were finally able to overcome the
              city’s defenses and fulfill their quest. A contemporary account, The
              Deeds of the Franks, chronicles the massacre from a soldier’s perspective.
              As soon as one of the knights scaled the fortifications,

                  all the defenders of the city quickly fled along the walls and through
                  the city. Our men followed and pursued them, killing and hacking,
                  as far as the temple of Solomon, and there was such a slaughter that
                  our men were up to their ankles in the enemy’s blood . . . Entering

                                                                                           125

           126    Jihad or the Crusades?

                 the city, our pilgrims pursued and killed the Saracens up to the
                 temple of Solomon. There the Saracens assembled and resisted
                 fiercely all day, so that the whole temple flowed with their blood.
                 At last the pagans were overcome and our men seized many men
                 and women in the temple, killing them or keeping them alive as
                 they saw fit . . . Then the crusaders scattered throughout the city,
                 seizing gold and silver, horses and mules, and houses full of all sorts
                 of goods. Afterwards our men went rejoicing and weeping for joy to
                 adore the sepulchre of our Saviour Jesus and there discharged their
                 debt to Him.2

               Shortly after this bloody conquest, the crusader lords wrote a letter
           to the pope, chronicling their journey and culminating in a description
           of how the Muslims suffered at their hands. “If you desire to know what
           was done with the enemy who were found there, know that in Solomon’s
           Porch and in his temple our men rode in the blood of the Saracens up to
           the knees of their horses.”3
               These are the records of history, and the nine hundred intervening
           years do nothing to blur the vivid images of the First Crusade in the
           collective memory of modern Muslims.


           AMERICAN MUSLIMS, THE CRUSADES, AND JIHAD
           I cannot speak for all American Muslims, but my family is very patri-
           otic. My father served the US Navy faithfully for twenty-­four years,
           starting as a seaman and retiring as a lieutenant commander in 2000.
           It was he who taught me, while I was visiting his naval base in Groton,
           Connecticut, to put my hand over my heart while reciting the national
           anthem. My mother, among other matters, impressed on me the impor-
           tance of voting. On the day of a presidential election, I discovered that
           my parents were voting for opposing candidates. When I suggested to
           my mother that they should both just stay home that night since their
           votes would cancel out, she responded, “Son, it is our duty to vote.”
               In those years, we traveled often to New York City for vacation since

              heart, developed a great love for the city. Her eyes always grew large when
              staring up at the skyscrapers, and she never left Manhattan willingly.
              Throughout her teen years, the most prominent decoration in her room
              was a large, framed image of the New York City skyline on her wall. It
              was still there on September 11, 2001, when our world crashed around us.
                   I am convinced that the attack on the World Trade Center hit patri-
              otic American Muslims harder than the average citizen. We reeled with
              the rest of the nation at the deaths of fellow Americans, but we were
              simultaneously hit with an identity crisis. The terrorists had killed our
              countrymen in the name of our God. As we were trying to come to grips
              with these opposing realities, most Americans had no dilemma because
              they could simply denounce Islam. We were forced to somehow stand
              up for our faith while also standing up for our country, all in light of
              the potential that people would demonize not just Islam but us Muslims
              as well.
                   Thankfully, prominent Americans stood up to defend Muslims,
              not the least of whom was former president Bill Clinton. In a speech
              in Washington, DC, less than two months after the attack, Clinton
              said, “In the first Crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem,
              they . . . proceeded to kill every woman and child who was Muslim on the
              temple mound. The contemporaneous descriptions of the event describe
              soldiers walking on the temple mound, a holy place to Christians, with
              blood running up to their knees. I can tell you that that story is still
              being told today in the Middle East and we are still paying for it.”4
                   President Clinton, who had always been popular with our Muslim
              community, was impressing upon his audience that Christians had been
              guilty of wanton violence in the name of their God. This sentiment
              resonated with Muslims more than Clinton may have realized, because
              it accorded with the narrative that we had inherited in the Islamic com-
              munity: Islam had spread peacefully after the advent of Muhammad
              only to be opposed by violent crusaders in the East and the Spanish
              inquisition in the West. Christians were the aggressors, and Muslims
              were the victims. Jihad, so we had learned, was either a spiritual or a
              defensive enterprise.
                   Along with Clinton’s admission, it seemed that others were coming




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 127                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           128    Jihad or the Crusades?

           to agree with this perspective. Most Americans I knew looked at the
           Crusades with shame. A scholar at Georgetown University, John Esposito,
           described the Crusades as the beginning of hostilities between Muslims
           and Christians: “Five centuries of peaceful coexistence elapsed before
           political events and an imperial-­papal power play led to a centuries-­long
           series of so-­called holy wars that pitted Christendom against Islam and
           left an enduring legacy of misunderstanding and distrust.” Sharing a
           similar understanding, Ridley Scott released a movie in 2005 called The
           Kingdom of Heaven, which depicted Christians as the aggressors against
           civil Muslims who simply desired peaceful coexistence. At that time,
           it seemed to me that jihad had been vindicated even in the eyes of the
           West and that no one could point a finger at Islam, given the atrocities
           of the Crusades.
                Still, I was convinced that no one should judge a religion by its
           followers. That’s why, as I was considering the truth of Christianity
           and Islam, I would not allow mujahideen—­those who enact jihad—­to
           impact my view of Islam, and I would not allow crusaders to impact my
           view of Christianity. In my mind, there were only two people whose
           behavior mattered: Muhammad and Jesus. I was convinced that neither
           crusaders nor mujahideen had anything to do with the original teach-
           ings of their religions.
                But that, as I found out, was a step too far.


           THE CRUSADES IN CONTEXT
           Many years after leaving Islam, while conversing with colleagues, I
           expressed my dismay at Christians who take the name of Christ but do
           not try to live according to his principles. When I used the Crusades
           as an example of such hypocrisy, a good friend challenged me with a
           very straightforward question: “Nabeel, have you ever investigated the
           history of the Crusades?” To my shame, I had to admit that I had not.
           I just assumed that everyone agreed the Crusades were an abomination
           and an inexcusable blight upon Christian history. Without condoning
           the atrocities, my colleague suggested I take a fresh look at the Crusades
           so I could have a well-­rounded understanding.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 128                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                      The First Crusade     129

                  When I started investigating, it immediately became clear that nei-
              ther party in these wars had clean hands. In 1268, Sultan Baybars I, a
              Muslim notoriously known as the Lion of Egypt, taunted a Christian
              ruler whose city had just been conquered in the latter’s absence. Baybars
              vividly describes what Count Bohemond VI would have seen had he
              been present in Antioch:

                       Death . . . came among the besieged from all sides and by all
                  roads: we killed all whom you appointed to guard the city or defend
                  its entrances. If you had seen your knights trampled under the feet
                  of horses, your provinces given up to pillage, your riches distributed
                  by full measures, the wives of your subjects placed on the market
                  for sale; if you had seen the altars and crosses overturned, the leaves
                  of the Gospel torn and cast to the winds, and the sepulchers of your
                  ancestors profaned; if you had seen your enemies, the Muslims,
                  trampling upon the tabernacle and burning alive monks, priests,
                  and deacons in the sanctuary; in short, if you had seen your palaces
                  given up to the flames, the dead devoured by the fire of this world,
                  the Church of St. Paul and that of St. Peter completely and entirely
                  destroyed, certainly you would have cried out, “By Heaven, I wish
                  that I had become dust!”5

                  According to the records, Baybars torched Antioch and emptied the
              city of its inhabitants. Fourteen thousand Christians were killed, and
              a hundred thousand were taken into slavery. This is an atrocity on par
              with the First Crusade’s massacre in Jerusalem. I was not expecting this,
              as the narrative I had always heard was that the crusaders were the only
              ones perpetrating atrocities, not Muslims. It occurred to me that the
              only way to vindicate my inherited narrative was if this massacre was
              belated retribution for what the crusaders had done in 1099, so I started
              studying the context of the battles, including the First Crusade. It was
              then that I discovered that the narrative I had inherited was lamentably
              misinformed.
                  Just a few years before Pope Urban II called the First Crusade, the
              Seljuq Turks had conquered Nicaea, the same city where, 750 years prior,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 129                                                     7/1/16 1:57 PM

           130    Jihad or the Crusades?

           Constantine had convened the church’s First Ecumenical Council. The
           Seljuq Turks were Sunni Muslims, and they had taken Nicaea from
           the Byzantine emperor, a Christian. It was he, the Byzantine emperor,
           who asked Pope Urban II for help defending his lands at the Council of
           Piacenza in 1095. In other words, Muslims were actively attacking and
           conquering Christians, and the First Crusade was a defensive effort.
               But what I learned next was even more shocking: The Seljuq army
           contained warriors called mamluks, slave children who were trained to
           ultimately become young professional fighters. These slave warriors
           were first used by Muslim caliphs in the ninth century, and for the next
           thousand years they were ubiquitous in Islamic lands. According to one
           scholar, sixteen of the seventeen preeminent Muslim dynasties in history
           systematically used slave warriors.6 These slave boys were often captured
           from places like Egypt, where Christian territories had been conquered
           by Muslims. This means Muslim rulers were capturing Christian boys
           and turning them into slave warriors to fight against other Christians.7
               The records indicate that Muslims had been conquering Egyptian
           Christians and taking their children since the early days of Islam. Amr
           ibn al-­A s, one of Muhammad’s companions, brutally swept through
           Northern Egypt in AD 640, just eight years after Muhammad’s death.
           John of Nikiu, a bishop in the Nile delta, records one such conquest:
           “[W]hen with great toil and exertion they had cast down the walls of the
           city, they forthwith made themselves masters of it, and put to the sword
           thousands of its inhabitants and soldiers, and they gained an enormous
           booty, and took the women and children captive and divided them
           amongst themselves, and they made that city a desolation.”8
               Reading through John’s chronicles, I found that this was one of
           Amr’s more merciful conquests. He records the capture of Nakius, a
           city left defenseless when its soldiers fled the oncoming Muslim army.
           John tells us how Amr treated the undefended Christians: “Amr and the
           Muslim army . . . made their entry into Nakius and took possession.
           Finding no soldiers, they proceeded to put to the sword all whom they
           found in the streets and in the churches, men, women, and infants.
           They showed mercy to none. After they had captured this city, they
           marched against other localities and sacked them and put all they found




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 130                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                    The First Crusade    131

              to the sword . . . Let us now cease, for it is impossible to recount the
              iniquities perpetrated by the Muslims after their capture of the island
              of Nakius.”9
                   This was just one of many massacres the bishop records of Amr ibn
              al-­A s, the friend of Muhammad. History records similar Muslim attacks
              on Christian lands from the mid-600s through the year 1095 and well
              beyond. By the time the Byzantine emperor asked for the pope’s help,
              two-­thirds of the Christian world had been captured by Muslims.
                   This is why Crusade scholar Thomas Madden says, “The crusades
              were in every way a defensive war. They were the West’s belated response
              to the Muslim conquest of fully two-­thirds of the Christian world.”10
              When we read the full context of Pope Urban II’s plea to European
              Christians for the First Crusade, this becomes abundantly clear:

                      Your brethren who live in the east are in urgent need of your
                  help, and you must hasten to give them the aid which has often
                  been promised them. For, as most of you have heard, the Turks and
                  Arabs have attacked them . . . and have overcome them in seven
                  battles. They have killed and captured many, and have destroyed
                  the churches and devastated the empire. If you permit them to
                  continue thus for awhile with impunity, the faithful of God will be
                  much more widely attacked by them. On this account I, or rather
                  the Lord, beseech you as Christ’s heralds to publish this everywhere
                  and to persuade all people of whatever rank, foot-­soldiers and
                  knights, poor and rich, to carry aid promptly to those Christians
                  and to destroy that vile race from the lands of our friends.11

                  Further context is also enlightening. The pope ordered no slaughter
              of Jews, and as some crusaders were massacring Jews in the Rhineland,
              other Christians were protesting and doing all they could to protect them.
              The Archbishop Ruthard of Mainz tried to shelter Jews at his personal
              residence until he was overcome by Count Emicho. The bishops of Speyer
              and Worms similarly tried to protect the Jews as best they could. The
              crusaders who were killing Jews were defying their Christian leaders and
              brothers, and their actions ought not be imputed to all of Christendom.

           132    Jihad or the Crusades?


           REVISITING THE NARRATIVE OF THE CRUSADES
           This is at least one reason why not all Christians in the First Crusade
           should be painted with the same brush. Historical understanding
           requires a more careful approach, and when we start analyzing the
           Crusades from a nuanced perspective, even more becomes clear. For
           example, we ought not see the Crusades as simply “Christians versus
           Muslims” or vice versa. Christians and Muslims were far too divided
           for such a monolithic view. Christians were not united among them-
           selves, which is why it ultimately took hundreds of years for the Western
           Christians to come to the aid of the Byzantine Christians.
               Muslims were even less united, which is the primary reason the
           crusaders were able to conquer Jerusalem in 1099. The Seljuq sultan had
           just died in 1092, and multiple family members were vying for power.
           The Fatimid dynasty, a Shia caliphate based in Egypt, took advantage
           of this internal division to wrest control of Jerusalem from the Seljuq
           Empire in 1098, just one year before the Crusade. The Fatimids them-
           selves had just come out of a civil war, and they were still in turmoil
           from the deaths of their caliph and his grand vizier in 1094. Their
           inveterate enemies, the Abbasid Muslims, had just lost their caliph in
           1094 as well, and these factors all combined to leave the terribly divided
           Muslim lands prone to attack. This is why Crusade scholar Jonathan
           Riley-­Smith says, “Although none of the crusaders knew it, they were
           marching toward a door that had swung wide open.”12
               Clearly, there were many competing interests vying for power in
           the region. Medieval historian Christopher Tyerman tells us, “The
           appearance of the western armies of the First Crusade in 1097–8 merely
           added one more foreign military presence to an area already crowded
           with competing rules from outside the region.”13 The crusaders were
           just one interest among many. In fact, they were among the less relevant
           ones, since they were essentially defeated when Saladin retook Jerusalem
           in 1187.
               Perhaps that is why Muslims more or less forgot the Crusades
           until the end of the nineteenth century. According to Riley-­Smith,
           “The Muslims looked back on the Crusades with indifference and




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 132                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                   The First Crusade   133

              complacency. In their eyes, they had been the outright winners . . . The
              first history of the Crusades in Arabic, which had appeared in 1865, had
              been a Christian one.” Christians had to invent an Arabic word for the
              Crusades, as Muslims apparently did not give much thought to them
              until the turn of the twentieth century.14
                   Considering the historical realities, the common Muslim perspective
              of the Crusades—­the perspective I inherited—­is a modern invention.
              The narrative of an offensive Crusade against peaceful Muslims, along
              with the overtones of Ridley Scott’s The Kingdom of Heaven and John
              Esposito’s “five centuries of peaceful coexistence,” turn out to be fanciful
              slants based on motivations other than history. The reality is that the
              Crusades were launched in defense of the Byzantine Empire after two-­
              thirds of the Christian world had been conquered by centuries of Muslim
              attacks. Muslims understood this and held no grudge against crusaders
              until modern times, when postcolonial narratives came into vogue.


              LEARNING FROM JIHAD AND THE CRUSADES
              Given the facts, did crusaders commit inexcusable atrocities? Absolutely.
              Did mujahideen commit inexcusable atrocities? Absolutely. In no way do
              I intend to excuse those who committed these crimes. All the same, I do
              not think a religion ought to be judged on the basis of some of its fol-
              lowers. The actions of some Christians do not necessarily say anything
              about Christianity, and the actions of some Muslims do not necessarily
              say anything about Islam. As I concluded while still a Muslim, what
              matters are the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of Muhammad.
                  But it is a step too far to say that neither crusaders nor mujahideen
              have anything to do with their religions. As it turns out, both Jesus and
              Muhammad had a lot to say about violence, and the crusaders and the
              mujahideen were listening.

                 COMPARING THE TRADITIONS
                     OF THE FOUNDERS


           I  n 2009, David Wood and I received invitations to the Islamic Society
              of North America’s annual convention, themed “Life, Liberty, and
           the Pursuit of Happiness” and held over the Fourth of July weekend
           in Washington, DC. We registered to attend, eager to hear the mes-
           sages and mingle with the Muslim attendees. We watched lectures on
           the history of the Quran and the status of women in Islam, we met
           with acclaimed Muslim scholars, and we even interviewed one of the
           conference organizers. Although we thought there was a great deal of
           misinformation, there is no doubt that the organizers and speakers were
           very hospitable and sincere about their messages.
               Many of my Muslim childhood friends and acquaintances were at
           the conference, and I made awkward attempts at reconnecting with
           them. Two such friends, both former members of the Ahmadiyya sect
           who had become Sunni Muslims, were willing to join David and me for
           dinner after the conference. Talking over halal Chinese food, the four
           of us discussed a full range of topics, but what sticks out in my mind is
           our conversation about apostasy.
               “What do you think,” I asked one of my friends, “about the pun-
           ishment for leaving Islam?” I was curious because my friend, a former
           Ahmadi, had come from the most peaceful sect of Islam, whereas the
           Sunni Muslim punishment for apostasy is a violent death.
               “There’s no question here,” he began. “The Prophet (SAW) made it
           abundantly clear that apostates must be killed for leaving Islam.”1 His
           serious tone gave no hint of ambivalence.

                  “I agree that he did,” David piped in, “but come on! You can’t really
              think that people should be killed for their beliefs? I mean, this is the
              twenty-­f irst century. People believe in freedom of worship.”
                  My friend did not budge. “Leaving other religions is fine, but people
              should be killed for leaving Islam. Yes, there is freedom of worship here
              in America. Since it is illegal to kill apostates, American Muslims are
              bound by the law of the land and cannot kill former Muslims. But in
              Muslim countries, apostates can and should be killed.”
                  I could not believe what my friend was saying. I had to challenge
              him just a little more to see how serious he was. “So if we were in a
              Muslim country right now, would you kill me?”
                  Matter-­of-­factly, without malice or sarcasm, he responded, “Yes, I
              would kill you right now. It is the command of the Prophet (SAW).”
                  There was pin-­drop silence at the table as everyone waited for me to
              respond. “Well then,” I laughed, “I praise God we’re not in a Muslim
              country! God bless America!” The blunt attempt at humor moved the
              conversation along, but his words remain emblazoned in my mind.


              PEACEFUL MUSLIMS, APOSTASY,
              AND THE EXAMPLE OF MUHAMMAD
              The contrast between my friend’s view and the conference’s theme was
              jarring. All weekend long, the conference was trying to prove that Islam
              is compatible with American values and Western freedoms, but here
              was a fervent young Muslim who was saying that American law was the
              only thing keeping him from killing me for my beliefs. How can we
              understand the disparity?
                   My friend did what Muslims have traditionally done: He turned
              to the example of Muhammad for sharia. The hadith are full of ref-
              erences to Muhammad’s killing apostates and ordering them to be
              killed.2 Therefore, there is little question for the Muslim who follows
              Muhammad as his exemplar: Apostates ought to be killed. The evidence
              is so solid that all major schools of Sunni Islam and Shia Islam teach the
              law of apostasy, disagreeing only about the details and circumstances.
                   Of course, killing people for their beliefs is an assault on the

           136    Jihad or the Crusades?

           sensibilities of Western morality, including the sensibilities of many
           Muslims in the West. So in adapting their understanding of Islam to
           fit Western notions of morality, they often argue that Islam could never
           teach such a thing. Unfortunately, quite the opposite is true: Islam
           always has. From a historical perspective, denying the punishment of
           apostasy is a modern phenomenon, as is insistence on a predominantly
           peaceful Islam.3
               Some Muslims point out that the Quran does not command the
           killing of the apostates, and arguably they are correct. But Islam is
           not a sola scriptura faith; it has always used hadith to supplement the
           Quran. Anyone who prays the five daily prayers would have to admit
           this, because not only are the words for the prayers not given in the
           Quran, even the number of daily prayers is not mentioned. The Quran
           mentions only three daily prayers, and it does not delineate the words or
           postures for any of them. Although there are legitimate “Quran-­only”
           Muslims, they have always been an extreme minority in Islam. Most
           Muslims who argue against the law of apostasy using a Quran-­only
           approach are using reasoning that would radically alter their Islamic
           practice if applied consistently.
               Along similar lines, some peaceful Muslims argue against the law of
           apostasy based on Quranic verses such as 2.256, which says, “There is no
           compulsion in religion.” In order to say this, though, they are also disa-
           vowing Muhammad’s example. Muhammad did not interpret that verse
           in that manner, as his actions in hadith repeatedly show. That is why,
           classically, Muslim theologians have listed 2.256 among the abrogated
           verses we discussed in the previous chapter.4 Ibn Kathir, for example,
           says 2.256 was abrogated by 9.29, which tells Muslims to fight Jews and
           Christians.5 Popular Muslim scholars have vociferously defended these
           traditional interpretations throughout the twentieth century.
               Of course, I hope peaceful Muslims gain the majority voice in the
           international Islamic community and sway Islamic practice in their
           favor. Far from being insincere, most Muslims who advocate a peaceful
           practice of Islam truly believe it is a religion of peace. At my mosque,
           that is exactly what we were taught and what we repeated to others.
           But in order to follow a peaceful Islam, one has to ignore or reject vast

              swaths of traditions from Muhammad’s life as well as virtually the entire
              history of Islamic jurisprudence.
                  My friend in DC used to be a part of the same peaceful mosque
              my family attended, and he was taught by the same peaceful imams.
              Ultimately, he left that version of Islam and embraced a more violent
              one in the name of following Muhammad’s true teachings. Muslims
              who most consistently follow the records of Muhammad’s life believe in
              an Islam that would not satisfy Western notions of peace. These are the
              majority of Muslims throughout history.


              MUHAMMAD AND JIHAD
              The Economist published an article titled “The Persistence of History”
              on August 22, 2015. The first image of the article is chilling: dozens
              of burka-­clad Nigerian teenage girls kidnapped from their school in
              Chibok by Boko Haram. The article goes on to speak of thousands
              of Yazidi women captured by ISIS, the Islamic State. In Dabiq, ISIS’s
              professionally produced magazine, ISIS argues that these women are
              spoils of war and that sex slavery is a practice sanctioned by the Quran.
                   Does Islam allow sex slavery? We must do as my friend in
              Washington, DC, did, and as Muslims have always done, to answer
              questions like this: turn to the hadith. When we turn to the example of
              Muhammad’s life, we find multiple accounts of Muhammad not just
              allowing sex slavery but also encouraging Muslims who were hesitant
              to use their newly captured women for sexual intercourse.6 Whether
              they were hesitant because they were afraid the women would become
              pregnant or because their husbands were still alive, according to the
              hadith, Muhammad encouraged them. The hadith say that this is the
              very reason why 4.24 of the Quran was revealed, so that men would
              not be hesitant to have sex with female captives whose husbands were
              still alive. These accounts of Muhammad’s life influenced Muslims
              throughout the classical age of Islam and delineated their rules of war.
              These are the accounts to which ISIS appeals now.
                   Of course, many Muslims disagree with ISIS’s practice, but their
              reasons are enlightening. An open letter sent by 140 Muslim scholars to




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 137                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           138    Jihad or the Crusades?

           ISIS reads, “After a century of Muslim consensus on the prohibition of
           slavery, you have violated this; you have taken women as concubines.”7
           They argue that Muhammad looked favorably on releasing slaves, which
           may very well be true, but they do not go so far as to say that Muhammad
           did not allow sex slavery. That is simply not what the records show, and
           ISIS knows it. Unfortunately for these 140 Muslim scholars and for
           the rest of the world, ISIS is interested not in the consensus of Muslim
           scholars one hundred years ago but in the example of Muhammad in
           the seventh century.
               ISIS takes not only females captive but also boys. The world was
           recently horrified by accounts of captured boys being made to remove
           their clothing and facing execution if they were found to have pubic
           hair. But once again, this practice was based on Muhammad’s treatment
           of the Qurayza Jews. Muhammad had commanded that, except in night
           raids, children could not be killed in war. So when a group of people
           were taken captive, such as the Qurayza Jews, the boys were separated
           from men by the growth of pubic hair, and the men were executed.8 ISIS
           was simply lifting this account from Muhammad’s life and applying it
           to their own circumstances.
               Of course, this allowance of Muhammad also explains why the
           Seljuq Turks and virtually all other Muslim dynasties had no qualms
           about capturing boys and making them slave warriors. Muhammad
           himself enslaved Jewish boys, perhaps a merciful act in light of the fact
           that their fathers were all beheaded that day.
               So jihad, in its classical practice and in those manifestations consid-
           ered “Islamist” or “radical” today, is often an attempt to simply follow
           Muhammad. Those who argue for more peaceful practices of Islam
           have to do one of three things: deny the example of Muhammad’s life
           altogether, like the Quran-­only Muslims; proclaim Muhammad’s teach-
           ings defunct, like the 140 Muslim scholars; or disavow select portions of
           Muhammad’s life as recorded in history, like the average Muslim.

              JESUS AND THE CRUSADES
              Following Jesus results in a very different notion of warfare. Jesus never
              led an army; far from it, he never even sanctioned violence. When it
              comes to Jesus’ clearest dictum on fighting, there is no missing his
              message: “Put your sword back in its place . . . for all who draw the
              sword will die by the sword” (Matt. 26:52 NIV). Even in matters of
              self-­defense, his teaching is so utterly peaceful that it seems to come
              from another world: “I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone
              slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And
              if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat
              as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles”
              (Matt. 5:39–41 NIV). This works in tandem with the otherworldly way
              Jesus tells his followers to treat their enemies: “Love your enemies and
              pray for those who persecute you” (Matt. 5:44 NIV).
                   Jesus’ teachings were so peaceful that they posed a problem for
              early Christians who felt obligated to defend the oppressed with vio-
              lence. Because Jesus made no clear allowance for war, such Christians
              developed an elaborate notion of “just war” starting with Augustine at
              the turn of the fifth century. Delineating stringent conditions of war,
              Augustine argued that fighting could be within the will of God, but it
              remained a necessary evil and something that required penance.
                   When launching the Crusades, Christians relied on the arguments
              of Augustine and other similar perspectives to vindicate their defense of
              the Byzantines, and they initially did treat their wars as a necessary evil
              to combat a greater evil. It was during the Crusades, though, that holy
              war started to be seen positively, itself a means of gaining forgiveness. In
              this, they were going far further than Augustine.
                   This idea gained popularity, as a contemporary historian wrote,
              “God has instituted in our time holy wars, so that the order of knights
              and the crowd running in their wake . . . might find a new way of
              gaining salvation.”9 So it was not until the Crusades, over a thousand
              years after Jesus, that Christians saw holy war as a positive endeavor
              that, instead of being a sin requiring penance, would actually forgive
              crusaders of their sins.

           140    Jihad or the Crusades?


           COMPARING MUHAMMAD AND JESUS ON VIOLENCE
           By contrast, it was Muhammad himself who taught that fighting in jihad
           was holy and good. According to hadith, Muhammad taught Muslims
           that invading the Christian city of Constantinople would purge muja-
           hideen of their sins: “The first army amongst my followers who will
           invade Caesar’s city will be forgiven their sins.”10 Fighting in jihad was
           so good in Muhammad’s eyes that there is nothing equal to it in this
           world.11 When a man asked him if there was any deed in this world equal
           to jihad, Muhammad responded, “I know of no such deed.”12
                Recapping the chronology: Jesus’ clear words against violence led to
           over three hundred years of nonresistance among Christians, and then
           Augustine’s arguments led to six hundred years of war as a justifiable
           evil. It was not until Christians were a thousand years removed from
           Jesus that they believed holy war could purge sin, whereas Muhammad
           himself taught Muslims that fighting in jihad can forgive sin, and
           indeed is the best thing in the world.
                There is much more to be said about jihad and the Crusades,13 but
           one matter is beyond dispute: The historical Jesus never sanctioned
           violence and endorsed absolutely nothing like the Crusades, whereas the
           historical Muhammad engaged in jihad as the greatest deed a Muslim
           can perform. Violent jihad is a result of strict adherence to the life and
           teachings of the historical Muhammad, whereas strict adherence to the
           life and teachings of the historical Jesus results in pacifism and sacrifi-
           cial love for one’s enemies.

                         QUESTIONING CHRISTIAN
                             PEACEFULNESS


              A     week after David Wood and I went to ISNA’s 2009 national
                    convention, we traveled to London to engage Muslims in public
              dialogue and debate. Of the twenty or so public debates in which I have
              participated, my favorite was the one that David and I did together,
              dialoguing with two former Christians who had converted to Islam.
              The topic was “Is Islam a Religion of Peace?” and in addition to the
              interesting subject matter, the two-­on-­two nature of the debate kept
              the interaction fast-­paced and gripping. An audience member after
              the debate commented that it was “more exciting than football,” and I
              would agree, because I assume he meant soccer.
                  During the course of the debate, it became clear that the two Muslim
              debaters were in part arguing that Islam was peaceful when juxtaposed
              with a certain view of Christian teachings. Focusing on words of Jesus
              such as, “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.
              I did not come to bring peace, but a sword” (Matt. 10:34 NIV), they
              argued that Christianity allowed for violence in certain instances, and
              so does Islam. If Christianity is peaceful though violence is allowed,
              Islam can be peaceful as well.
                  To be fair, Augustine and Christians after him provided justification
              for war in part by asking questions about passages like these. But my
              response to Augustine would be the same as our response was to the
              Muslim debaters: “What is Jesus actually saying in this verse? We should
              read the context.” In context, it is incontrovertibly clear that Jesus is
              talking not about war but about division among families: “I did not

                                                                                   141




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 141                                             7/1/16 1:57 PM

           142    Jihad or the Crusades?

           come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn ‘a man against
           his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-­in-­law against her
           mother-­in-­law—­a man’s enemies will be the members of his own house-
           hold’” (vv. 34–36 NIV). There is nothing here about war.
               This is a common misunderstanding I have encountered among the
           Muslims I converse with: They challenge the peaceful teachings of Jesus
           by taking his words out of context. As we saw in part 4, this makes
           sense given Quranic exegesis and its relative lack of emphasis on context.
           But in biblical exegesis, the context of a passage is an essential element
           in determining its meaning. When Jesus says he has come to bring a
           sword, he tells us exactly what he means by that statement: His advent
           will divide families.
               An even closer study of Jesus’ words reveals that the “sword” to which
           Jesus refers is not a rhomphaia, the kind of sword used only for war.1 The
           sword that Jesus brings is a machaira. Like a machete, a machaira is a
           long knife or a short sword designed as a multipurpose tool, such as
           cutting meat or cleaning fish. Also like a machete, a machaira can be
           used for fighting, but it is not its only or primary purpose. Its primary
           purpose is to divide, and here Jesus says his coming is as a machaira to
           divide families.
               This clarification helps us understand another commonly misunder-
           stood passage. In Luke 22:35–38, Jesus tells his disciples to take swords,
           machaira, with them on their journey.2 Ancient Christians in favor of
           Just War asked the same question many modern Muslims ask today:
           “Why would Jesus have told his disciples to bring a sword if not to
           fight, or at least defend?” Now that we know what a machaira is, the
           answer is simple: He was telling them to be prepared for a long journey
           and to take along the appropriate tools. Context is helpful again: Jesus
           gives them a list of traveling accessories to take with them (money belt,
           bag, and sandals), and the sword appears in that list. As if to clarify
           this, Jesus told his disciples that two swords would be enough. If he
           envisioned a battle, two swords would never have been enough among
           that many; but they are plenty if envisioned as traveling tools.
               Another verse that can cause confusion if context is ignored is Luke
           19:27, in which Jesus says, “But those enemies of mine who did not want




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 142                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

              me to be king over them—­bring them here and kill them in front of me”
              (NIV). Reading the whole passage makes the statement clear. Jesus is
              telling a parable, sharing a teaching about a hypothetical king. He is not
              actually demanding that his enemies be brought before him and killed.
              Throughout the gospel of Luke, Jesus tells many parables, including
              ones about an evil judge who ignores a woman (Luke 18), a farmer who
              sows seeds (Luke 8), a vineyard owner who orders a tree to be cut down
              (Luke 13), and a woman who searches for a lost coin (Luke 15). These
              parables are not meant to imply that Jesus himself is an evil judge who
              ignores women, that he is a farmer who sows seeds, that he is a vineyard
              owner who orders trees to be cut down, or that he is a woman looking for
              a coin. Similarly, his parable in Luke 19:27 is not meant to imply that he
              is a king who wishes to kill people. Rather, Jesus uses stories to provide
              memorable illustrations, and his parable in Luke 19:27 prefigures the
              outcome of those who have rejected God on the final day of judgment.
                   One last matter to consider regarding these verses is a basic axiom
              of hermeneutics: Always interpret unclear verses in light of clear ones.
              Jesus’ clear words and teachings remain “love your enemies” and “put
              away your sword.” Never in the Gospels do we find Jesus carrying a
              sword, and the only physical altercation in the Gospels results in Jesus
              castigating his disciple for fighting.3 This, in addition to the context
              of the verses in question, helps the reader see the consistency of Jesus’
              peaceful teachings.


              VIOLENCE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
              Another common objection from the Islamic perspective, one which the
              two debaters raised during the very first minute of our public dialogue
              in England, pertains to violence in the Old Testament. Although there
              are many ways to formulate the objection, its primary thrust is that God
              commands violence in the Bible, therefore Christianity is not peaceful.
              As we saw in part 4, this objection fails because Christians are under
              a new covenant, not the covenant made with Moses and the Hebrews.
              The commands that God gave the Jews are not the commands given
              to Christians.

           144    Jihad or the Crusades?

                Yet there are related, more nuanced objections that deserve attention.
           God does command violence in the Old Testament. For this reason, as
           a Christian I do believe God can command violence. As a corollary, I
           cannot object to Islam simply based on its use of violence.
                All the same, the nature of the violence is significantly different in
           the Old Testament versus in Islam. What we see in the Old Testament
           is judgment commissioned by God in a very specific time and place, a
           judgment deferred for four hundred years. In Genesis 15:13–21, God
           promises Abraham that his descendants will inherit the land of Canaan.
           Abraham himself, though, will not receive this land because “the sin of
           the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure” (Gen. 15:16 NIV).
           God foretells the violent battles of the Hebrews against the Canaanites,
           but the Canaanites would be given four hundred years to repent. This
           is the violence we see in the Old Testament: judgment directed toward
           specific peoples on account of specific sins, and deferred for as long
           as possible.
                The violence taught by Muhammad, on the other hand, extends to
           all non-­Muslims in Islamic lands unless they fulfill certain conditions.
           According to the Quran, polytheists are given three options: convert to
           Islam, depart from the land, or be killed (e.g., Quran 9.3–11). These
           options are not limited to place or person but apply to all who do not
           believe in Islam in lands claimed by Muslims. Looking again at the text,
           9.5 says, “Kill the polytheists wherever you find them, and seize them,
           and besiege them, and wait for them at every place of ambush. But if
           they repent and establish salaat and give zakaat, then leave their way.” In
           other words, the Quran commands Muslims to kill people for being
           polytheists, but if they become Muslim, then leave them be. The next
           verse offers an additional option of exile.
                Jews and Christians are allowed a further option in the Quran:
           pay a ransom tax in submission (e.g., Quran 9.29). In this case, it is
           even more clear that the violence is based on their beliefs. The Quran
           literally says, “Fight those who do not believe in Allah . . . nor acknowl-
           edge the true religion, from those who were given the scripture [i.e.,
           Jews and Christians].” In other words, fight Jews and Christians who
           do not acknowledge Islam or believe in Allah. The next verse makes




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 144                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                    Questioning Christian Peacefulness   145

              the reasoning clear: “The Jews said Ezra is the Son of God and the
              Christians said the Messiah is the Son of God . . . May Allah destroy
              them.” Their doom is merited on account of their beliefs. This was the
              verse that justified an offensive attack against the Romans in the ill-­fated
              Battle of Tabuk, even though the Romans had never attacked Muslims.4
                  Given these teachings, it should be no surprise that the records of
              Muhammad’s life in Sahih Muslim show him saying, “I will expel the
              Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any
              but Muslim.”5 The violence he espouses in the hadith and sirah do not
              appear to be limited to specific people or a specific time.
                  Before moving on from this point, it is worth mentioning chro-
              nology. These verses promoting violence against Jews, Christians, and
              polytheists are all found in chapter 9 of the Quran, and according to the
              Islamic records, this was the last major chapter of the Quran revealed to
              Muhammad.6 The Quran’s last words and marching orders, as it were, are
              the most violent teachings found in its pages. This is especially important
              given the traditional Islamic notion of abrogation, which teaches that
              earlier verses can be cancelled by later ones.
                  The violence in the Old Testament, on the other hand, was part
              of God’s campaign of making his sovereignty known early in Jewish
              history; it is nowhere near the last word of the Bible. For Christians
              in particular, the final marching orders are the Great Commission: to
              spread the good news of God’s love and mercy throughout the world by
              multiplying disciples of Jesus.
                  Whereas the culmination of Quranic teaching is the most violent
              chapter of the Quran, the culmination of biblical teaching is grace, love,
              mercy, and self-­sacrifice. When we approach the violence of the Old
              Testament carefully, we see it has very little bearing on Christian praxis.
                  This conclusion reinforces our basic assertion: One must divert
              attention from Jesus to justify violence in Christianity. A strict adher-
              ence to Jesus’ teachings simply allows no basis for violence. By contrast,
              one must divert attention from Muhammad to argue that Islam is a
              religion of peace, since he says that a Muslim who does not fight in jihad
              or at least express a desire to fight is a hypocrite.7

                           JESUS VERSUS JIHAD


           B     efore leaving London in July 2009, David and I made a stop at
                 Speakers’ Corner in Hyde Park. For a few hours every Sunday,
           Britons gather for a rousing display of free speech in the park, tak-
           ing to ladders to proclaim their messages amid throngs of listeners.
           From politics to protests to proselytization, orators are never short of
           subjects or passion at Speakers Corner, and hundreds gather to hear.
           Although many are present simply to heckle the speakers or otherwise
           observe such spectacles, some in the audience are truly interested in
           dialogue.
               David and I, each being over six feet tall, forsook ladders and
           proclaimed the gospel where we stood. We were almost immediately
           surrounded by Muslims who loudly challenged our views in return.
           Responding to them over the din of the crowd was more difficult than
           I had anticipated, and after about thirty minutes of dialogue and repar-
           tee, my voice grew too hoarse to continue. I abandoned my efforts and
           joined the various discussions that had sprung up around us.
               I spotted two impassioned interlocutors and decided to join their
           conversation. A young Mennonite woman was dialoguing with a
           Muslim man on the issue of women’s rights. When the young woman
           referred to 4.34 of the Quran, which allows men to hit their disobedient
           wives, he responded that 1 Corinthians 14:34 goes further in denying
           women their rights. Up until this point, the dialogue was productive
           and I had simply observed the discussion, but what happened next has
           been etched in my mind for years.
               The young woman opened a Bible she had in her hand, intending
           to clarify the context of 1 Corinthians 14. While she was turning the

           146




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 146                                             7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                  Jesus versus Jihad   147

              pages, the man forcefully pushed her hand down, saying, “I don’t trust
              your Bible. Don’t bother!”
                  Without thinking, I grabbed him by his lapel and shoved him back,
              saying, “Don’t you dare touch her!”
                  He was stunned, a genuine look of shock across his face. “Nabeel,”
              he said, “you’re a Christian! I thought Christians were pacifists!”
                  Still a little hot under the collar, I retorted, “I’m no pacifist, and
              if you touch her again you’ll really find out!” Perhaps he realized his
              mistake, or perhaps he wanted to avoid finding out how not-­pacifist I
              was, but he apologized to the young woman and they continued their
              dialogue.
                  Years later, I cannot help but recall his stunned expression. He was
              utterly convinced that Christians must be pacifist, and as I consider
              Jesus’ words more carefully, I have to wonder whether he was right. My
              actions in Hyde Park that day illustrate, in a very microcosmic sense,
              that defending victims with violence is a natural reflex. But throughout
              the Gospels, Jesus teaches us to forsake our natural inclinations for his
              otherworldly teachings.
                  Could it be that, even when it comes to defending victims, Jesus
              does not want Christians to fight? Honestly, I am not sure. I find such
              a teaching hard to believe, but if I were pressed on the matter, I think I
              might have to default to Jesus’ words in Scripture and forsake violence
              altogether, even defensive violence.
                  Although this is a dilemma for me as a Christian, being caught
              between pacifism and defending the oppressed, I think it is an excel-
              lent place to be theologically. It means that Christians who want to
              engage in defensive violence must do so while reckoning it as a moral
              abomination. No adherent of Jesus’ teachings can entertain the notion
              of violence as inherently good, even defensive violence. This would have
              been very different if Jesus had sanctioned some sort of violence. Such
              an allowance would invariably have opened the door for those predis-
              posed to shedding blood.
                  This is what we see occurring throughout Islamic history—­with
              ISIS today and with other inevitable Islamists in the future. Even
              Muslims who believe that Islam is a religion of peace generally concede




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 147                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           that Muhammad allowed fighting under some circumstances, and it
           is the life of Muhammad to which Islamists appeal in order to justify
           their terrorism.
                If Muhammad, after gaining an army, commissioned or partic-
           ipated in eighty-­six battles over the course of nine years, one would
           consider such activity among his followers to be inevitable. By contrast,
           it is beautiful that Jesus Christ, the exemplar for Christians, is never
           once reported to have even carried a sword. That leaves his followers
           somewhere between an otherworldly reliance upon God in pacifism and
           a reluctant use of violence for the defense of the oppressed. There is
           absolutely no room for exulting in violence for the follower of Jesus.

              CAN WE KNOW WHETHER ISLAM
                OR CHRISTIANITY IS TRUE?




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 149                     7/1/16 1:57 PM

           A      decade of experiences as a Christian contrasted with my first
                  twenty-­two years of life as a Muslim leaves me no alternative
           conclusion: Christianity is very different from Islam. The message it
           preaches is pure grace, the God that it proclaims is objective love, its
           founder on earth was none other than the incarnate God, its scriptures
           are communal and diverse, and it leaves no room for exulting in violence.
           Islam, as traditionally understood, differs significantly at every turn.
               Virtually no one with a conservative, devout upbringing in Islam
           would be under the illusion that Christianity is the same as Islam, espe-
           cially not someone with as much to lose as Fatima. After growing up
           Muslim and passionately defending her faith, she became disillusioned
           with Islam and left her religion. It was in full awareness of Islam’s teach-
           ings that she found Jesus’ message compelling. So not only did Fatima
           realize that the two are different, but the fact that she was willing to
           accept Christianity after leaving Islam testifies that the differences
           make a difference, and it was worth whatever risk.
               I journeyed from Islam to Christianity as well, but my path was
           not quite the same as Fatima’s. I did not first become disillusioned with
           Islam, nor did I see the beauty of the gospel. As compelling as I find the
           Christian message now, I did not find it compelling at all as a Muslim.
           I believed that Allah was loving, that Muhammad was peaceful, that
           the Quran was beautiful, that tawhid was the perfect doctrine, and that
           truly following sharia made one righteous before Allah. I did not feel any
           need for the gospel, and I certainly did not see it as a superior message.
               But despite my preference for Islam, I had met people from a
           plethora of religious backgrounds, and there was an undeniable trend:
           Christians preferred Christianity, Jews preferred Judaism, Hindus pre-
           ferred Hinduism, and so on for all people from all backgrounds. Was
           that why I, as a Muslim, preferred Islam?

           150




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 150                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                            Can We Know Whether Islam or Christianity Is True?   151

                  Recognizing that people tend to be more than comfortable with
              their given worldview, I did not want to base my faith in Islam simply
              because it was compelling to me. Rather, I was a confident Muslim
              because I believed Islam was the truth.


              THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH
              As a passionate young Muslim, I used to proclaim Islam’s teachings to
              whoever would hear me. In my mind, there was not the least shred of
              potential that Christianity was true, so I regularly engaged in dialogue,
              advancing the claims of Islam against the claims of Christianity.
                  In this, Christianity and Islam are different from many other reli-
              gions. While worldviews often provide subjective reasons to believe,
              Christianity and Islam both make claims about the past that can be
              tested against the records of history. When it comes to the person of
              Jesus, their truth claims are contradictory, and both cannot be true.
                  For example, a foundational Christian teaching is that Jesus died by
              crucifixion in the first century (Mark 15:37; Matt. 27:50; Luke 23:46;
              John 19:33; Acts 10:39; 1 Cor. 15:3). By contrast, the Quran teaches
              the exact opposite: Jesus was not killed, nor was he crucified (4.157).
              Neither religion treats these accounts of Jesus as a myth, so we cannot
              resolve these contrary positions in some metaphorical sense. He either
              died by crucifixion or he did not. Either Islam or Christianity has to
              be wrong.
                  Being absolutely convinced that Islam was correct on all such mat-
              ters, I was more than ready to challenge Christianity’s truth claims in
              order to call people to Islam. That was the reason why I started investi-
              gating, to convert people to Islam, particularly my friend David. David
              challenged me, though, to apply equal standards of investigation to
              both Christianity and Islam. Of course, being convinced of the truth
              of Islam, I agreed and attempted to study the religions as objectively as
              I could.
                  Examining the claims of Islam and Christianity over four years, I
              went from utter conviction in Islam to reluctantly embracing the gospel.
              The evidence in favor of Christianity was so strong I had no choice.

           152    Can We Know Whether Islam or Christianity Is True?

           What I discovered during my journey is what I will be sharing in the
           next five parts of this book.


           THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY
           When David and I started discussing our faiths, we began somewhat
           haphazardly. Just a few weeks after having met, while on the road for
           a university event, we ended up rooming together. As the evening was
           drawing to a close, David pulled out his Bible from his backpack and
           started reading. Having been trained as a young Muslim to dispute
           Christianity, I challenged him, charging the New Testament with
           textual corruption. That encounter opened the door to a wide range of
           conversations, from the inspiration of Scripture to inerrancy to Jesus’
           deity and the Trinity and much more. It was an organic flow from
           one topic to the next, covering issues as they arose in the course of our
           friendship.
               There certainly was value in discussing these matters in the contexts
           of our real lives, but after a year of such discussions, I realized that my
           knowledge of Christianity was more shallow than I originally thought.
           It was not that I realized I was wrong; rather, I simply noticed I was not
           able to defeat David’s arguments. For the sake of being more careful
           and thorough, I wanted to start investigating these matters more sys-
           tematically. It was then that we tried to distill Christianity and Islam
           to their cores.
               At minimum, what would need to be true in order for the Christian
           message to be true? Conversely, what would need to be true for the
           Islamic message to be true? We wanted to cut through all the fluff and
           distraction, and these questions allowed us to get past all the less rele-
           vant matters and denominational disputes. There are many branches of
           both religions that have different doctrines, but neither David nor I was
           interested in sect-­specific teachings or peripheral issues. What defines
           Christianity at its core, and what defines Islam?
               For Christianity, we found the answer in Romans 10:9: “If you
           declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that
           God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (NIV). Here we found




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 152                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

              the entire gospel message formulated as the minimum requirement for
              saving faith. It has three components: (1) that Jesus died, (2) that he rose
              from the dead, and (3) that he is God.1
                  Thankfully, each of these three components can be tested from a
              historical angle. Did Jesus die on the cross or not? As we just saw, this
              is a fundamental teaching of Christianity that would have happened
              in history, so we can open the pages of our historical records to see if
              they support or rebut Jesus’ death. The same is true for his resurrection.
              Although it would be a supernatural event, it would still have happened
              in history, so we can investigate the historical records to see if they cor-
              roborate the truth claim that Jesus rose from the dead. Lastly, do the
              historical records indicate that Jesus claimed to be God or not?
                  If all three are true, we have good reason to accept the Christian
              message, as these three components together form a compelling case. To
              illustrate, we should remember that many people claim to have super-
              natural authority and be divine. Usually such claims are pathological
              delusions of grandeur, and we are more than justified in dismissing
              them as madness. But if someone were to demonstrate their supernatu-
              ral authority to validate their claim, then that would give us good reason
              to believe them.
                  In other words, if someone were to say, “I am God,” we would think
              them crazy; but if they were to then say, “I will prove my claim by rising
              from the dead,” and then they actually were to rise from the dead, we
              would have good reason to believe them. This is exactly what Jesus says
              the resurrection is for.2 When people who were skeptical of Jesus’ claims
              asked him for a sign, he said that the one sign he would show them is
              his resurrection.
                  Therefore, if history testifies that Jesus claimed to be God and rose
              from the dead, we have good reason to accept the Christian message.
                  One very important matter to note about the core of the Christian
              faith is that Islam rejects all three components. The Quran explicitly
              denies that Jesus ever claimed to be God (5.116), and it also explicitly
              denies that he died by crucifixion (4.157), thereby implicitly denying
              that he rose from the dead.
                  To understand my journey, and to understand the fundamental




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 153                                                          7/1/16 1:57 PM

           154    Can We Know Whether Islam or Christianity Is True?

           incompatibility between Islam and Christianity, it is absolutely critical
           to internalize this point: The central claims of Christianity are explic-
           itly rejected by Islam. Islamic doctrine is antithetical to the core message
           of Christianity. Evincing the case for Christianity disproves Islam, and
           vice versa.
                As we have already explored, there are many points of agreement
           between Islam and Christianity, even regarding the life of Jesus, such as
           his virgin birth and ability to work miracles. But none of those points of
           agreement are the central proclamation of the gospel; the Scriptures do
           not say, “If you believe in the virgin birth, you will be saved.” It does say
           we need to believe Jesus is God, that he died, and that he rose from the
           dead. Islam categorically denies these beliefs.


           THE CASE FOR ISLAM
           When David and I considered how to distill Islam down to its essence,
           we found the answer clearly in the shahada: “There is no God but Allah,
           and Muhammad is his messenger.” At minimum, one must believe that
           Allah is God and that Muhammad is his appointed messenger in order
           to be a Muslim.
                But is Allah, the God of Islam, the one true God?3 And is Muhammad
           truly a messenger of God? To investigate these, one must turn to the
           Quran and the records of Muhammad’s life. The Quran, being Allah’s
           self-­revelation and the “why” of Muslim belief, must be carefully scru-
           tinized. Similarly Muhammad, being the only direct recipient of the
           Quran and a presence in the shahada, must be critically examined to
           determine whether he actually is a messenger of God.
                If we can determine that the Quran is the Word of God, or if we
           can determine that Muhammad is a messenger of God, then we have
           good reason to accept Islam. Unlike the Christian case, where all com-
           ponents need to be true to build the case, defending the prophethood
           of Muhammad vindicates the inspiration of the Quran and vice versa.
           The case for Islam should therefore, in concept, be easier to establish,
           as only one point needs to be well defended: either the prophethood of
           Muhammad or the inspiration of the Quran.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 154                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

                  So, after careful consideration, David and I chose to study these
              five points:

                  1. Jesus’ death by crucifixion
                  2. Jesus’ resurrection from the dead
                  3. Jesus’ claim to be God
                  4. The prophetic authority of Muhammad
                  5. The divine inspiration of the Quran

                  Together, these five points constitute the case for Christianity and
              the case for Islam.


              THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE
              AND THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY
              Missing from this list, perhaps conspicuously, is the divine inspiration
              of the Bible. Although David and I had investigated the Bible, and its
              inspiration was very important for Christian doctrine, we both realized
              that it constituted the “what” of the Christian faith, not the “why.”
              Wanting to focus on the minimal requirements for Christianity, we had
              to exclude many matters that were very important but not central to the
              case, and the inspiration of the Bible was one such matter. Theoretically,
              even if the Bible had never been written, Jesus could still have died on
              the cross for our sins and risen from the dead, making the Christian
              message true. The inspiration of the Bible is not central to the case
              for Christianity.
                  Unlike the Bible, the Quran is the “why” of Muslim belief. When
              skeptics challenged Muhammad to provide evidence for his claims,
              the primary proof he provided was the inspiration of the Quran.4
              Repeatedly, at least five times, he offered the divine origin of the Quran
              as the reason why people should trust Islam. By contrast, when the early
              Christians proclaimed the gospel, the primary proof that they pointed
              to was the resurrection of Jesus, not the text of the Bible.5
                  For these reasons, the Quran forms a central pillar in the case for
              Islam, whereas Jesus forms the pillar in the case for Christianity. This




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 155                                                          7/1/16 1:57 PM

           156    Can We Know Whether Islam or Christianity Is True?

           accords with what we have already learned about Islam and Christianity:
           The Quran and Jesus are the analogues in the two faiths, not the Quran
           and the Bible.
               That said, let us be careful not to conflate divine inspiration and
           historical reliability. We will be considering what various books of the
           Bible say about Jesus’ death, resurrection, and deity, so it behooves us to
           consider whether their records on these matters are historically reliable.
           But of course, assessing the accuracy of specific claims found in books
           of the Bible is very different from determining whether or not the whole
           Bible is the inspired Word of God.
               No early Christian ever argued the latter as a defense of the gospel,
           so we will not consider that argument here, though we will be consid-
           ering the historical reliability of the Bible as far as it affects our case
           for Christianity. By contrast, on account of being the primary proof
           offered by Muhammad and early Muslims, we will be considering the
           inspiration of the Quran.


           OBJECTIVITY: DEFENDING THE FAITH
           VERSUS ASSESSING THE FAITH
           Before diving into this investigation, I want to share something that
           took me years to really grasp: It is virtually impossible to study these
           matters objectively. Not only do we all have a vested interest in defend-
           ing the faiths we and our social circles have believed for years, but our
           beliefs also color the way we receive information. The same data will
           be interpreted differently by people from disparate worldviews. When
           we investigate Islam and Christianity as devout believers in one faith or
           the other, our Christian or Muslim presuppositions affect the way we
           interpret the evidence, and we often see what we want to see.
               When I started investigating the data, I came to the table with the
           presupposition that Islam was true, and I interpreted the data accord-
           ingly. No matter what facts David provided, I either made them fit my
           Islamic paradigm or I found some way to dismiss them. It is not difficult
           to defend what you already believe, and anyone who sets their mind to
           it will be able to do so, whether Muslim, Christian, or anything else.

                   What is difficult is pursuing the truth about your faith and assessing
              it honestly. This feat requires one to be introspective and self-­critical
              at frequent intervals. Although we can never completely overcome our
              biases, the most important step we can take is to pursue fair-­mindedness
              with intentionality. While considering the data, we need to repeatedly
              ask ourselves the question: “Would an objective observer find the argu-
              ments compelling?”
                   In the next five parts of this book, I will regularly raise this question
              while assessing the cases for Christianity and Islam. After examining the
              first three points, which impact the case for both Islam and Christianity,
              there will be a midway summary to solidify the findings to that point
              before examining the case for Islam.
                   While still a Muslim, I decided that the best question to start inves-
              tigating would be the one that is a fulcrum of disagreement yet is easy
              to investigate historically, allowing the least room for subjectivity: Did
              Jesus die on the cross?

                                THE POSITIVE CASE
                                       UNANIMOUS RECORDS




              I  n 2002, David and I arranged a friendly interfaith dialogue with my
                 father and two of David’s friends, Mike Licona and Gary Habermas.
              Mike was a martial arts instructor and insurance salesman who had
              started pursuing graduate studies in religion, and Gary was one of his
              professors. Gary had participated in many interfaith dialogues, Mike
              regularly hosted people from different religious backgrounds at his
              home, and my father was always enthusiastic about proclaiming Islam,
              so everyone felt comfortable gathering together and discussing deeply
              held beliefs.
                   Part of the reason I felt comfortable, though, was because I had
              chosen a topic that we had heard discussed dozens of times by Muslim
              leaders and scholars: Did Jesus die by crucifixion? In addition to our
              relative familiarity with the topic, the Quran took a bold stance on the
              matter, and I was confident in the word of Allah.
                   The Quran explicitly denies Jesus’ death by crucifixion. In 4.157,
              it states, “And their [sic] saying, ‘indeed we killed the Messiah, Jesus
              son of Mary, messenger of Allah.’ But they did not kill him, nor did they
              crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them. And those who disagree
              about it are in doubt about it. There is not anything of knowledge in
              this for them except the pursuit of conjecture. They did not kill him, for
              certain” (emphasis mine).
                   Muslims interpret this verse in multiple ways. The view that my
              father and I were defending that day was the view that Muslim debaters
              like Ahmed Deedat and Shabir Ally espoused: Jesus did not actually die

                                                                                    161




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 161                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

           162    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?

           on the cross but rather just appeared to die. Although this is the position
           of notable Muslim intellectuals, it is the minority among Muslims at
           large. The majority of Muslims, going back to the earliest commentaries
           in Islam, believe that Jesus’ visage was placed on another person who
           was crucified in his place.
               My father presented our view for the first part of the evening, and
           Mike and Gary then interacted with us, explaining their reasons for
           believing that Jesus did actually die on the cross.


           SCHOLARLY UNANIMITY
           The most salient point of the evening for me, the one that mattered most
           to a mind accustomed to thinking in terms of authority, is that virtually
           no non-­Muslim scholar agrees with the Islamic position. For all intents
           and purposes, there is a unanimous opinion within academia that Jesus
           died by crucifixion. Although scholarly unanimity is not evidence per
           se, it was a jarring perspective check.
                Of course, I was not in the least surprised that Christian scholars
           were unanimous on this point. What surprised me was the insistence
           from non-­Christian scholars that this matter was so firmly established
           that it was beyond dispute.
                Gerd Lüdemann is a German scholar who so doubted the Bible that
           he infamously said, “The person of Jesus himself becomes insufficient as
           a foundation of faith.”1 Yet even he did not mince words when it came
           to Jesus’ death. In his book, What Really Happened to Jesus, Lüdemann
           critically reexamines the life of Jesus from many angles, often dismissing
           the traditional Christian position outright. But in his section titled “The
           death of Jesus,” he spares only two sentences: “The fact of the death of
           Jesus as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable, despite hypotheses
           of a pseudo-­death or a deception which are sometimes put forward. It
           need not be discussed further here.”2 He then moves on, as if lingering
           on the matter were pointless.
                Paula Fredriksen, another well-­known scholar who frequently chal-
           lenges Christian beliefs, also concludes similarly to Lüdemann, positing,
           “The single most solid fact about Jesus’ life is his death: he was executed

                                                                    The Positive Case   163

              by the Roman prefect Pilate, on or around Passover, in the manner Rome
              reserved particularly for political insurrectionists, namely, crucifixion.”3
                   The matter was stated most succinctly by perhaps one of traditional
              Christianity’s most evocative critics, John Dominic Crossan, who says,
              “There is not the slightest doubt about the fact of Jesus’ crucifixion
              under Pontius Pilate.”4 As if that were not emphatic enough, he else-
              where states, “That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can
              ever be.”5
                   Having been a graduate student of historical studies for the past
              decade, I have learned that scholars disagree on almost every historical
              point they discuss, and it is almost impossible to find scholarly unanim-
              ity, yet virtually all New Testament scholars today agree that Jesus died
              on the cross. Even those scholars who have no hesitation in dismissing
              traditional Christian beliefs, as we have seen, say that Jesus’ death by
              crucifixion is “indisputable,” “the most solid fact about Jesus’ life,” and
              “as sure as anything historical can ever be.”
                   I am not here arguing that Jesus must have died by crucifixion
              because virtually all non-­Muslim scholars believe it. That would be
              an appeal to authority, a logically fallacious contention. I am simply
              recounting what Mike and Gary pointed out to me that night, which
              caused me to consider just how much of an uphill battle we were fight-
              ing if we thought Jesus did not die on the cross. The evidence for Jesus’
              death by crucifixion is so strong that virtually every scholar who studies
              Jesus’ life believes it.
                   In fact, the evidence is so strong that at least one Muslim scholar
              agrees.6 In the flurry of media attention that followed the release of
              his book Zealot, Reza Aslan made it abundantly clear that Jesus “was
              most definitely crucified.”7 Aslan is one of the most well-­k nown Muslim
              scholars in the West, and on account of the historical evidence, he also
              believes that Jesus died on the cross, despite what the Quran teaches. He
              believes so strongly in Jesus’ death by crucifixion that he uses it as the
              foundation for his entire theory of Jesus’ life.
                   What is the evidence that so convinces all these scholars—­Christian,
              non-­Christian, and even Muslim?

           164    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?


           THE RECORD OF THE CROSS
           As I was taught by my professors at Oxford, the foundation for any good
           historical argument should always be the primary sources: What do the
           historical records themselves indicate?
               By all standards of ancient history, the reports of Jesus are very
           early and very diverse. Starting just a few years after Jesus’ crucifixion,
           Christians, Jews, and Romans report that Jesus died by crucifixion. The
           testimony is unanimous for over one hundred years.
               Perhaps the earliest reports are found in a letter written to the
           Corinthian church. According to many New Testament scholars,
           Christian and non-­Christian alike, 1 Corinthians 15 contains a creed
           that was formulated within five years of Jesus’ crucifixion, and it testi-
           fies that Jesus died and was buried: “For what I received I passed on to
           you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the
           Scriptures, that he was buried . . .” (1 Cor. 15:3–4 NIV).8
               It is critical to understand the import of this data: Before the New
           Testament was even written, Christians were passing down to one
           another the core doctrines of their faith, and the death of Jesus was
           among their first concerns. Not only was the teaching present in the
           very earliest days of Christianity, but also it was a central component
           of their doctrine. That we have a record of such tradition that comes
           within five years of Jesus’ death is almost unheard of in ancient history;
           in comparison with most historical records, it is lightning fast.
               Another such creedal formulation, one which many scholars
           believe also predates the New Testament, is found in the letter to the
           Philippians. Here again, we find Jesus’ death not just present, but
           highlighted: “[Christ Jesus] humbled himself by becoming obedient to
           death—­even death on a cross!” (Phil. 2:8 NIV).
               The earliest biographers of Jesus’ life all testify that Jesus died by
           crucifixion: Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. In addition, many other
           New Testament authors and books lend their weight in agreement.
               Without having carefully considered the implications, some might
           argue that these sources are from the Bible, and therefore are biased
           and ought not serve as evidence. There are at least two problems with




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 164                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                   The Positive Case   165

              this view. First, all historical sources are biased, and although we ought
              to weigh biases as we investigate, the sheer presence of bias is not
              reason enough to discredit reports. We would have to throw out all
              of history, indeed all news reports and personal stories from friends,
              if that were the case. Second, these sources are written by people of
              various backgrounds, and generally speaking, they did not start their
              lives as Christians. Though originally non-­Christians, they found the
              Christian message convincing enough to convert, often at great cost.
              Therefore, if anything, their testimony may be granted an extra measure
              of credibility.9
                  Regardless, the testimony of the early Christians is corroborated
              by non-­ Christian reports: Josephus, the failed Jewish general who
              befriended the Roman emperor, also reports in the first century that
              Jesus died by crucifixion. He is joined shortly after by Tacitus, a Roman
              historian who also reports Jesus’ death.
                  In the first one hundred years after Jesus, we have Christian, Jewish,
              and Roman reports that Jesus died by crucifixion, and not a single
              report that he may not have died by crucifixion.
                  This last fact is more compelling when we consider the report that
              some people were trying to explain why Jesus’ tomb was empty.10 Instead
              of arguing that Jesus did not die on the cross, they argued that his body
              was stolen. So even though there was a perfect opportunity to suggest
              that Jesus did not die by crucifixion, it appears that this argument did
              not occur to anyone.
                  And there is a good reason for this: People were all too familiar with
              the terror of the cross.


              THE TERROR OF THE CROSS
              Simply put, the cross was one of the most vicious, torturous, and effec-
              tive methods of execution that human depravity has ever devised. The
              torment of the cross was so extreme that a word was invented to describe
              it: excruciating, which translates from Latin to describe a pain “from
              the cross.”
                   Cicero, the ancient roman orator, describes crucifixion as “that




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 165                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           166    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?

           most cruel and disgusting penalty” and “the worst extremes of torture.”
           According to him, even thinking about “the terror of the cross” was
           too horrible for Roman citizens: “The very word ‘cross’ should be far
           removed not only from the person of a Roman citizen but from his
           thoughts, his eyes and his ears.”11
               Seneca the Younger penned this paragraph, describing the despair
           of the crucified: “Can anyone be found who would prefer wasting away
           in pain, dying limb by limb, or letting out his life drop by drop, rather
           than expiring once for all? Can any man be found willing to be fastened
           to the accursed tree, long sickly, already deformed, swelling with ugly
           tumours on chest and shoulders, and draw the breath of life amid long-­
           drawn-­out agony? I think he would have many excuses for dying even
           before mounting the cross!”12
               Crucifixion was an execution reserved by Rome when they wanted
           to make a statement.
               There was no standard procedure for the crucifixion, as executioners
           were often given license to express profligate brutality. Victims were
           at times fixed to the cross in awkward poses, at times nailed through
           their groins, at times forced to watch the violation of their wives, at
           times made to witness the slaughter of their whole families, and at
           times having their slain sons hung around their necks.13 Crucifixion
           was not just another means of execution, as there are much more effi-
           cient ways to kill. The cross was intended for brutality, and victims
           were not treated gently.
               The cross often came after a flogging, as in the case of Jesus, which
           was itself a horrendous torture. The whip was designed to rip into skin
           and turn muscle to pulp, making a victim’s “blood flow in streams.”14
           Josephus tells us that victims were “whipped to the bone” and that their
           intestines were at times exposed by the flogging.15 This is why Seneca
           describes a victim, by the time he is on the cross, as a “battered and
           ineffective carcass.”16
               The ultimate end of crucifixion was execution, and it was easy to
           determine whether victims of the cross were alive or dead: Simply observe
           whether they were still moving. If they were not, they were dead, because
           it meant they were not breathing. On account of the way crucifixion




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 166                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                   The Positive Case   167

              victims were made to hang, their rib cages were fully expanded and their
              lungs could not generate the pressure necessary to exhale. In order to
              breathe out, they had to push up against the nail in their feet, and they
              could inhale as they sank back down. Once they had reached the limit of
              sheer exhaustion or blood loss, their bodies would sink down, they would
              no longer be able to breathe out, and they would die of asphyxiation.
                  That is why one method of expediting or ensuring the death of
              victims was to break their knees, as is reported to have occurred to the
              bandits on either side of Jesus. Once their knees were broken, they could
              no longer breathe out and they would soon expire.
                  Yet the Romans had other means of ensuring death. Among other
              methods, they were known to light peoples’ bodies on fire, to feed the
              bodies to wild animals, or, in the case of Jesus, to pierce the heart.
                  This is a highly condensed and abbreviated description of the terror
              of the cross. It was an execution reserved for what Rome deemed the most
              worthless or heinous of criminals. Perhaps now it is understandable why
              the word cross was used as a rank curse word among the lower class in
              ancient Rome: “Get crucified!”17 It should come as no surprise that never
              in recorded history has anyone survived a full Roman crucifixion.18
                  What should come as a surprise, though, is that a religious move-
              ment could ever be started with the ridiculous proclamation that their
              Savior was crucified.


              THE FOLLY OF THE CROSS
              Given the insuperable stigma of crucifixion, it should be a shock that
              Christians propagated their message by saying that their Savior died on
              the cross. How could Jesus save anyone if he died such a horrendous death?
                  That is why people ridiculed Christians for this belief. The earli-
              est known pictorial representation of Jesus on the cross is a drawing
              intended to mock a Christian named Alexamenos. It depicts Jesus on
              the cross as having the head of a donkey, and the scrawled caption reads,
              “Alexamenos worships his god!” To be crucified was exceedingly shame-
              ful; to worship such a one, even more so.
                  This is the focus of an anti-­Christian polemic written by Minucius




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 167                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           168    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?

           Felix, who says, “To say that their ceremonies center on a man put to
           death for his crime and on the fatal wood of the cross is to assign these
           abandoned wretches sanctuaries which are appropriate to them and the
           kind of worship they deserve.”19 In other words, if Christians are so
           degenerate that they worship a crucified man, they deserve to worship
           a crucified man.
                Not just Romans but also Jews saw the cross as a tremendous stigma.
           Deuteronomy 21:23 teaches that “the curse of God is on the one who
           is hanged on a stake (for capital punishment).” By and large, Jews were
           not expecting a suffering Messiah, let alone one upon whom rested the
           curse of God.
                This is why the Corinthian church had to be assured that, despite
           all appearances, the cross of Jesus was still good news: “For the message
           of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are
           being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor. 1:18 NIV). Once we recog-
           nize the common understanding of the cross, it makes complete sense
           why it would appear to be “foolishness.” Undoubtedly, the message of
           a “crucified messiah (is) a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to
           Gentiles” (1 Cor. 1:23 NIV).
                To Jews and non-­Jews, the message of a crucified Savior was abhor-
           rent and ridiculous. In other words, everyone who heard the message of
           the cross would have been repulsed by it, at least at first. It was certainly
           not an attractive proclamation.
                The question that we must consider, given that the cross would elicit
           such derision and aversion, is, Why would Christians preach such a
           message? Why not preach an alternative, more attractive message, like
           Jesus’ survival of the cross, or that, despite appearances, Jesus was never
           placed on the cross to begin with? Better yet, why not leave the cross
           out of Christian preaching entirely, teaching that he died by some other
           means or perhaps never died at all but was raised directly to heaven? All
           of these would have made the Christian message much more appealing
           to everyone who heard it.
                There is only one probable answer: Jesus actually did die by cruci-
           fixion, and the disciples were preaching what they had to preach if they
           wanted to proclaim the truth.

              SUMMARIZING THE POSITIVE CASE
              A whole book can be dedicated to Jesus’ death, as indeed dozens have,
              but we may summarize the positive case before considering the Islamic
              response.
                  The basis of any historical case must be the primary sources, and in
              this case, the sources are unanimous, diverse, early, and plentiful: Jesus
              died by crucifixion. Starting almost immediately after Jesus’ death, over
              a dozen authors and traditions recorded the death of Jesus by crucifixion,
              including Christian, Jewish, and Roman sources, and their testimony
              was unanimous. For more than one hundred years, no record even sug-
              gests that Jesus survived death on the cross or otherwise circumvented
              his execution. This coheres well with what we know of crucifixion prac-
              tices, in that there is no person in recorded history who ever survived
              a full Roman crucifixion. Positing that Jesus did not die on the cross
              would have served the agenda of the early Christians and those opposed
              to their message, but such a suggestion appears inconceivable.
                  For those who study Jesus’ life in academia, the idea that Jesus did not
              die by crucifixion remains, to this day, outside the realm of possibility.

                       THE ISLAMIC RESPONSE
                              IT WAS MADE TO APPEAR SO




           A     fter hearing the position of Gary and Mike, it was clear that on
                 this topic, my father and I would be fighting an uphill battle.
           Regardless, we argued the positions we had been taught in the mosque,
           and there was much to say. Here I will recount the bulk of what we
           argued, as well as present the more common Muslim argument against
           Jesus’ death.
               The Islamic responses to the argument above can be categorized
           according to the two main interpretations of 4.157. Recall the central
           portion of the verse: “They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him,
           but it was made to appear so to them.” The two most common interpre-
           tations place relative emphasis on different parts of this verse. The view
           that Muslim debaters often hold, that Jesus survived the cross, focuses
           on the first part—­“They did not kill him”—­whereas the majority view
           focuses on the latter part: “but it was made to appear so to them.”


           THEY DID NOT KILL HIM
           My father and I argued the position that Jesus was placed on the cross
           but he was not killed. Jesus miraculously survived the cross, was taken
           down alive, placed in a tomb to heal, and then escaped the clutches of
           the Romans.
               This is not the same theory that Christian apologists dubbed the
           Swoon Theory, which met its demise hundreds of years prior under the
           critical atheist scholar David Strauss. A naturalistic view, the Swoon

           170

              Theory argued that Jesus somehow survived crucifixion. Strauss’s critique
              was powerful: Even if Jesus had somehow managed to survive the cruci-
              fixion, his body would have been broken and mutilated, and he would
              have required desperate medical attention. The disciples may have been
              relieved that he survived, but that does not explain the inception or the
              preaching of the early church. According to the historical record, the
              disciples preached Jesus as the Lord of life risen in glory, and that belief
              propelled them to spurn death to such a degree that they were more than
              willing to die. According to Strauss, that would not have happened had
              Jesus just survived the cross.
                  The Christian apologists who had responded to the Swoon Theory
              focused on a different, more visceral point: If Jesus had somehow
              survived the cross, his feet would still have been broken, his hands para-
              lyzed, his sides pierced, his body mutilated and otherwise incapacitated.
              They argued that it would have taken a miracle for Jesus to even walk
              out of the tomb!
                  But as Muslims, we recognized that it would have taken a miracle,
              and that’s what we argued. This was what I called the Theistic Swoon
              Theory, and we argued that God miraculously preserved Jesus’ life on
              the cross. We presented the argument in a pithy package: “If God can
              perform the grand miracle of raising Jesus from the dead, why can he
              not perform a lesser miracle of preserving him from death in the first
              place?” In effect, it circumvented the inevitability of Jesus’ death. No
              matter how brutal the cross, God’s ability to preserve Jesus is greater.
                  We also argued that there were subtle traces of this divine design still
              present in the Gospels: Pilate did not want to kill Jesus on account of a
              dream God had given his wife; his attempt to release Jesus failed when
              the crowd demanded Barabbas; Pilate may have resorted to colluding
              with the executing centurion to ensure Jesus’ body was neither killed
              nor hung on the cross for the usual length of time; Joseph of Arimathea
              may have also conspired with Pilate, as evidenced by his request to have
              the body of Jesus; the women who came to the tomb must have brought
              aloes and myrrh for medicinal purposes; Jesus was disguised as a gar-
              dener in order to escape the guards; the holes in Jesus’ hands indicated
              he had not been raised from the dead, etc.

           172    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?

               We also argued that Jesus himself did not want to die, as demon-
           strated by his prayer in the garden of Gethsemane. Jesus was so anxious
           about the cross that he was sweating drops of blood. The best explana-
           tion of this, we argued, is that he was imploring God to save him from
           the cross. We coupled this contention with the verse from the epistle
           to the Hebrews, which reads: “During the days of Jesus’ life on earth,
           he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the
           one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his
           reverent submission” (Heb. 5:7 NIV).1 Allah, being a God of mercy who
           protected his prophets, heard Jesus’ prayers and miraculously saved him
           from death on the cross.
               Given that Allah is more than able to save Jesus, and that the biblical
           records still contained evidence in favor of this theory, we argued that
           Jesus did not die by crucifixion.


           BUT IT WAS MADE TO APPEAR SO
           The more common position among Muslims on Jesus’ death, however,
           is often called the Substitution Theory. It is the belief that Jesus’ face
           was placed on someone else. Most often, Muslims argue that this was
           either Simon of Cyrene, who literally switched places with Jesus as he
           was carrying the cross to the site of crucifixion, or Judas Iscariot, who
           justly deserved the punishment for betraying his prophet.
                This is a position that cannot be easily defended with historical
           argumentation, but it is often supplemented with such arguments, pri-
           marily criticisms of the biblical report. For example, a common charge
           is that the Gospels disagree as to what happened when the women went
           to the tomb on the third day. Mark’s gospel depicts a youth dressed
           in white, Matthew tells of an angel who rolled back the stone, Luke
           describes two men who appeared next to the women, and John says two
           angels were sitting where Jesus had been. The disagreement among the
           Gospels reflects the confusion in each of their reports; the writers did
           not know what actually happened.
                Those Muslims who argue the Theistic Swoon Theory also use these
           points to supplement their case, and the words of the Quran, “It was




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 172                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

              made to appear so,” also apply to their theory, but in a lesser sense.
              Allah performed the miracle of preserving Jesus’ life, and ultimately it
              appeared as if Jesus had died, whereas he did not. In the Substitution
              Theory, the words “it was made to appear so” have a much more active
              sense. The very miracle that Allah performs is making it appear as if
              Jesus had died, whereas he actually did not.


              CONCLUDING THE MUSLIM RESPONSE
              Ultimately, Muslims respond that, despite how it may have appeared,
              Allah saved Jesus from the cross. He may have done this either by mirac-
              ulously preserving Jesus’ body, as is subtly implied in the Gospels, or
              he may have done it by substituting Jesus with somebody else. On the
              whole, the biblical records are not reliable, and therefore there is no
              good reason to trust their account.

                             ISLAMIC RESPONSE
                    THE QURAN AND THE HISTORICAL JESUS




           B    oth major Islamic theories regarding Jesus’ death on the cross
                deserve a careful treatment. Let us consider each closely while dig-
           ging more deeply into the majority belief of the Substitution Theory by
           considering the context for some of the Quran’s teachings about Jesus.


           RESPONDING TO THE THEISTIC SWOON THEORY
           Before responding to the argument proper, it is worth noting what the
           verse of the Quran actually says: “And they did not kill him, nor did
           they crucify him.” The verse appears to say he was never even affixed to
           the cross, but we and other Muslims who argued the Theistic Swoon
           Theory took the latter clause to mean, “he was not killed by crucifix-
           ion.” So essentially, we interpreted the verse in this way: “They did not
           kill him in any way, and they did not kill him by crucifixion.” It was a
           strained interpretation, but pointing out problematic Quranic exegesis
           does not respond to the argument.
               To test the theory, we should isolate its main point: Although Jesus
           might have died on the cross under natural circumstances, he did not
           die because God miraculously preserved him. This, of course, is an
           explanation that requires a miracle, but we have to frequently remind
           ourselves that we are trying our best to investigate as objective observers.
           Should an objective observer conclude that such a miracle occurred?1

           174




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 174                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                   I would argue that an objective observer should not conclude that a
              miracle has occurred unless there is no other probable explanation, and
              even then only in special circumstances.2 In this case, there is another
              explanation, and it is extremely probable: Jesus died on the cross. For an
              objective observer to conclude that a miracle occurred in this case, one
              must believe that Jesus’ death on the cross is not even probable. But of
              course, it is more than probable; it is the obvious explanation.
                   Regarding the biblical verses cited as subtle traces of God’s divine
              plan, it needs to be pointed out that these verses occur in the context of
              four Gospels that repeatedly proclaim Jesus prophesied his death and
              that he did die. To extract verses from their context and say they assert
              the exact opposite of their context is a poor handling of texts, unless
              there is good reason to do so.
                   In this case, not only is there no good reason to do so, but also there
              is a good reason not to: The verses prophesying and proclaiming Jesus’
              death are abundant and clear, whereas these “subtle traces” are often
              solitary and require an unlikely interpretation. One of the basic rules of
              proper hermeneutics, whether Quranic or biblical or secular, is to inter-
              pret unclear statements in light of clear ones, not the other way around.
              To ignore the clear statements of Jesus’ death, and to point to these
              verses as hints that God saved him, is a poor method of investigation.
                   Some might point to the Gospels’ varying accounts, such as the
              scene at the empty tomb, as reason to discard the testimony of the
              Gospels, but that does not logically follow. A conservative Christian
              might respond that these verses can all be harmonized: In reality, there
              were two angels at the scene who appeared as young men. All four
              Gospel accounts are compatible with this understanding, though none
              of them say it explicitly. But even less conservative investigators who
              might agree that the accounts of the empty tomb are incompatible do
              not need to conclude that this somehow negates the uniform testimony
              of Jesus’ death on the cross. That does not logically follow.
                   In addition, the Theistic Swoon Theory does not cohere with impor-
              tant historical realities. For example, it casts Pilate in a God-­fearing
              light, willing to collude with Jews to save an innocent man. Historically
              speaking, the opposite appears to be true. Pilate was ruthless and did




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 175                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           176    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?

           not hesitate to kill Jews if it meant preserving order and Roman rule.
           This is true in history, as Josephus records Pilate’s willingness to kill
           innocent Samaritans3 as well as steal from the temple treasury and beat
           to death those who protested.4 And it is true in the Gospels as well, for
           even though he did not consider Jesus guilty, he ordered him crucified
           when faced with the threat of treason.
                Finally, and very problematic for the careful historian, the Theistic
           Swoon Theory gives no account for the inception of the Christian
           church. What was it that drove the early Christians to preach Jesus
           crucified and resurrected if they had themselves colluded in saving him?
           Were they liars, or must we discard additional reams of evidence and
           argue that they did not preach a crucified and resurrected Messiah?
           Ultimately, this theory requires the investigator to disregard not only
           all the evidence about Jesus’ death but also our entire understanding of
           early Christianity, though it is formed from dozens of sources. This is
           an important matter to which we will return in the midway summary
           after part 8.


           RESPONDING TO THE SUBSTITUTION THEORY:
           THE QURAN AS A SOURCE ON JESUS’ LIFE
           The Substitution Theory is even less of a historical argument than the
           Theistic Swoon Theory, and it must be remembered that no objective
           observer should conclude God conducted a miracle when an obvious
           explanation is available. Why would anyone argue that Jesus did not die
           and that God instead transposed Jesus’ image onto someone else? In this
           case, there really is little room for doubt: The basis for this Islamic belief
           is simply that the Quran asserts this.
                To be fair, though, we should assess the potential that the Quran
           is correct. Do we have good reason to believe the Quran might know
           something about Jesus that the New Testament missed? Of course, we
           have to remind ourselves that we are investigating as objective observers,
           and we cannot start off with the assumption that the Quran is inspired
           by God.
                Unless we can trace the Quran’s teachings about Jesus to an earlier




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 176                                                   7/1/16 1:57 PM

              time, we have to conclude that it is testimony six hundred years late
              and over six hundred miles removed, and it is therefore unlikely to tell
              us anything more accurately than the Gospels, whose accounts come
              from the lifetime of Jesus’ eyewitnesses and from the vicinity of his very
              community.
                   But the Quran’s teachings about Jesus can be traced to an earlier
              time. Much of what the Quran teaches was taught before. For example,
              let us consider 5.110: “When Allah says, ‘O Jesus, Son of Mary, remem-
              ber My provision upon you and upon your mother; when I strengthened
              you with the Holy Spirit and you spoke to the people while in the cradle
              and in maturity; and when I taught you writing and wisdom and the
              Torah and the Gospel; and when you made the likeness of a bird from
              clay, with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird
              with My permission; and you healed the blind and the leper with My
              permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission;
              and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you . . .’ ”
                   We will focus on the two teachings in italics, starting with the latter:
              the Quran teaches that Jesus miraculously gave life to clay birds. We
              find no narrative context for this miracle; it is simply provided in a list
              of Allah’s provisions for Jesus.5 But for those familiar with apocryphal
              gospels, they will already know the context of this story, because it
              is famous.
                   In the middle of the second century, people began to produce stories
              about Jesus, “fan fiction,” if you will, often situating their stories in his
              mysterious childhood years and focusing on his ability to do miracles.
              These fictitious gospels are called the infancy gospels. One of the more
              entertaining examples is the Infancy Gospel of Thomas.
                   In this infancy gospel, Jesus is five years old and particularly mis-
              chievous, often bullying other boys with his supernatural powers. While
              Jesus was by a mountain stream making puddles, another boy came
              and released the puddles, so Jesus cursed him and straightaway the boy
              withered. Later, another boy happened to run past Jesus and bump into
              his shoulder, so young Jesus cursed the boy, who died immediately. The
              parents of these boys came to Joseph and told him to control Jesus, at
              which Jesus struck them blind. When Jesus’ tutor tries to teach him




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 177                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

           178    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?

           respect for elders, five-­year-­old Jesus rebukes him and begins to teach the
           teacher instead! Everyone was amazed at what kind of child Jesus was.
               It is not until his teacher exclaims in frustration that Jesus must
           be an angel or God himself that Jesus laughs in approval and heals all
           the people he cursed. So the story continues, with boy Jesus using his
           miraculous abilities to curse some people, to cure others, to carry water
           inside his clothes, or even to fix furniture. His mischief relented when-
           ever people exclaimed that he must be God or an angel of God. In order
           to give the story an air of reality, the author concludes by tying this
           story into the gospel of Luke, in which Jesus is twelve years old and in
           the temple, where the elders were amazed at his knowledge, just as they
           were in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas.
               It is this entertaining fiction that gives us the context for the Quranic
           teaching that Jesus gave life to clay birds. Early in the story, when a
           certain Jew saw Jesus making clay birds on the Sabbath, he went to
           Joseph to accuse Jesus of doing what was unlawful on the sacred day.
           Knowing that fashioning clay birds on the Sabbath is unlawful, but
           playing with live birds is not, mischievous little Jesus blew life into the
           birds so he could get away with his indiscretion. Without providing the
           context, the Quran refers to this famous account in 5.110, assuming it
           to be historical truth.
               The same verse of the Quran also says that Jesus spoke to people
           while in the cradle. Sura 19 of the Quran, the chapter named after
           Mary, gives more details. Verse 23 shows Mary in the throes of child-
           birth, driven to lean against a palm tree. In her pain, she says, “O, I wish
           I had died before this!” In response, Jesus, to whom she is giving birth,
           says, “Do not worry, your Lord has given you a stream beneath you.”
           Shortly thereafter, when her people asked her if she’d had impious rela-
           tions, she gestured to Jesus implying they should ask him themselves.
           They respond, “How can we speak to a child in the cradle?” Baby Jesus
           responds, “Indeed, I am a slave of Allah. He gave me the scripture and
           made me a prophet.”
               This account has striking parallels with another infancy gospel,
           the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy of the Savior, otherwise known as
           the Arabic Infancy Gospel. In its introduction, after a few historical




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 178                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

              blunders regarding Joseph and Caiaphas, it says, “Jesus spoke, and,
              indeed, when He was lying in His cradle said to Mary His mother: I
              am Jesus, the Son of God, the Logos, whom thou hast brought forth, as
              the Angel Gabriel announced to thee; and my Father has sent me for the
              salvation of the world.”6 Baby Jesus’ proclamation in the Quran sounds
              very much like an Islamic version of baby Jesus’ proclamation in the
              Arabic Infancy Gospel.


              RESPONDING TO THE SUBSTITUTION THEORY:
              THE GNOSTIC INFLUENCE ON 4.157
              Many other Quranic teachings can be traced to earlier fictional
              accounts, but the important one for now is the message of 4.157: “He
              was not killed, nor was he crucified, but so it was made to appear.”
              Is there reason to believe that this teaching predates the Quran, and
              perhaps is more reliable than the gospel accounts?
                  As it turns out, another well-­k nown second century source taught
              exactly this. It is the Gospel according to Basilides,7 a Gnostic teacher
              whose school of thought lasted for centuries after his death. The word
              Gnostic refers to secret knowledge, as the Gnostics believed that people
              needed secret knowledge to be freed from the material world, which is
              inherently evil.
                  Irenaeus records what Basilides taught about the death of Jesus on
              the cross: “He [Christ] did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain
              man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this
              latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus,
              was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received
              the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them.”8
                  So Jesus was neither killed nor crucified, but it was made to appear so
              because he switched faces with Simon of Cyrene. This correlates exactly
              with the Substitution Theory, the majority interpretation of the Quran.
              But why did Basilides teach this? Was it because Basilides had access to
              some historical truth? If so, perhaps the Quran knows something the
              New Testament does not.
                  Gnostics had a wide range of beliefs, but one of the most common




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 179                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           180    Did Jesus Die on the Cross?

           was that there are many gods that have emanated from the Father, the
           unborn god. Basilides subscribes to this belief, teaching that the first
           emanation of the Father is the nous, or mind of the Father. That is Jesus,
           the firstborn god. After other emanations producing lower gods, it was
           the lowest god who created the material world. According to Basilides,
           that is the God of the Jews, along with his angels. The Father sent
           Jesus to deliver Gnostics from the God of the Jews, the creator of this
           evil world.
               Since the material world is evil, Basilides teaches Jesus must not have
           had a material body, and therefore he could not have been crucified. We
           find this stated in the passage that immediately follows:

                     For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous of the
                 unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus
                 ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as
                 he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all. Those, then,
                 who know these things have been freed from the principalities who
                 formed the world; so that it is not incumbent on us to confess him
                 who was crucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and was
                 thought to be crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the
                 father, that by this dispensation he might destroy the works of the
                 makers of the world.9

               So the Quranic teaching about Jesus that “they did not kill him, nor
           did they crucify him, but so it was made to appear” seems to trace back
           to a second-­century Gnostic source. This late, fictitious gospel is prop-
           agating “secret knowledge” to support its polytheistic worldview, not
           providing historical information about Jesus’ life. We can be confident
           that the account in 4.157 is not the kind that an objective investigator
           would consider reliable as historical evidence, and therefore we must
           reject the Substitution Theory.

                                                       Assessing the Islamic Response   181


              RESPONDING TO THE SUBSTITUTION THEORY:
              A FINAL WORD ON CONTEXT
              A Muslim investigator, such as I was, might be tempted to respond that
              the Quranic verses are from Allah, not from these fictitious sources, and
              that they are historically sound regardless. But as before, I needed to fre-
              quently remind myself that I was investigating as an objective observer
              and could not conclude this without assuming the Quran was inspired.
              The chronological priority of the fictitious gospels is obvious, as is the
              fact that their accounts are not historically sound.
                  But there is an even more powerful reason to challenge that notion.
              The information in these three passages makes excellent contextual
              sense in the fictitious gospels but little or no sense in the Quran. In the
              Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Jesus blew life into clay birds as a miraculous
              mischief-­maker, which fits the context perfectly; in the Arabic Infancy
              Gospel, he spoke words at birth because he was the eternal Word of
              God; in the Gospel according to Basilides, he was neither killed nor
              crucified because he was divine and did not have a material body.
                  But in the Quran, why does Jesus give life to clay birds? No reason or
              context is provided; the Quran simply refers to a well-­k nown account.
              Why can baby Jesus speak at birth? Again, no reason is provided; he just
              can. Why was Jesus not crucified, and why was someone else made to
              appear like him? The Quran does not suggest a reason; it simply asserts
              this secret knowledge as true.
                  These three accounts fit much better in the context of the fictitious
              gospels, and given that the Quran is a later source than all of them, we
              ought to conclude that the Quran’s ideas about Jesus come from these
              late, fictitious sources that are historically unreliable and theologically
              opposed to Islam.

                                            Chapter 24



                                      CONCLUSION
                                JESUS DIED ON THE CROSS




           L     eaving Mike’s house that evening, I did not change my mind about
                 Jesus’ death. One can rarely overturn a lifelong belief overnight.
           But one thing was becoming clear to me: My belief that Jesus did not die
           on the cross was based on faith in Islam, not facts of history. Historically
           speaking, the evidence regarding Jesus’ death was categorically in favor
           of Christianity and against Islam.
                Of course, Islam could still be true. If there were other good argu-
           ments to believe the Quran, such as the common Muslim arguments for
           the inspiration of the Quran, and if those arguments outweighed the
           historical evidence of Jesus’ death, then I would be justified in main-
           taining my faith in the Quran and in Islam. For that reason, as far as my
           personal beliefs were concerned, I did not falter in my Islamic faith. In
           my heart I believed that the Quran would be vindicated soon enough.
                But, as far as my investigation on this issue was concerned, I recalled
           my commitment to objectivity and had to be honest with myself.
           Would an objective observer conclude that Jesus died by crucifixion?
           Of course, the atheist and agnostic scholars answered that question for
           us with a resounding voice: Yes, one certainly would. The reasons were
           overwhelming: The record of Jesus’ death appears at lightning speed,
           it is asserted dozens of times within a hundred years, and the chorus of
           reports is composed of Christian, Jewish, and Roman voices. No one
           had ever survived a full Roman crucifixion, and had Jesus done so, that
           would have been a much more appealing message for the early church to
           proclaim than was the stumbling block of a crucified Savior.1

           182

                                                                            Conclusion   183

                  Islam’s responses, the Theistic Swoon Theory and the Substitution
              Theory, are not plausible, both because they suggest miracles in the face
              of much more obvious, probable explanations and because they would
              require a total overhaul of the historical realities of early Christianity, as
              we will explore further shortly. In addition, as a historical source about
              Jesus’ life, there is very little reason to trust the Quran because it was
              composed six hundred years after Jesus and more than six hundred
              miles away from where he lived. Although there are accounts in the
              Quran that come from an earlier period, those are from late, fictitious
              gospels that are historically unreliable.
                  In conclusion, we have to agree with Gerd Lüdemann: “The fact of
              the death of Jesus as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable.”

                  DID JESUS RISE FROM THE DEAD?

                                            Chapter 25



                                THE POSITIVE CASE
                        THE BEST EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS




              J  esus’ death on the cross is not the end of the Christian message. The
                 gospel is that Jesus then rose from the dead. Whereas every other life
              ended in death, Jesus’ death ended in life, and his resurrection is the
              basis of all Christian confidence. Death is nothing to be feared. Jesus
              has conquered it, and we are in him.
                  His resurrection has been the locus of Christian confidence from
              the inception of the church. In the book of Acts, Luke records the first
              Christian sermon, in which Peter concludes by proclaiming the resur-
              rection: “God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it”
              (Acts 2:32 NIV). In his next recorded sermon, Peter says, “You killed
              the originator of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are wit-
              nesses of this” (Acts 3:15).1 No fewer than eleven passages in the book of
              Acts record the early church proclaiming Jesus’ resurrection. This was
              the message that established the early church: Jesus rose from the dead.
                  But the importance of the resurrection is perhaps stated most clearly
              by Paul, who says in 1 Corinthians 15:14, “And if Christ has not been
              raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith” (NIV). Christian
              preaching and Christian faith are useless if Jesus remains dead and was
              not raised. If he did not overcome death, neither will we.
                  Did Jesus rise from the dead? Do we have good reason to believe in
              Christ’s resurrection? If so, it is a solid foundation for Christian faith. If
              not, Christians are the most pitiful people of all.2
                  That was what Mike argued about a year after my father and I sat in
              his living room, but this time, seven hundred other people were listening.

                                                                                        187

           188    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

           In 2004, Mike Licona debated Shabir Ally, the famous Muslim debater,
           on the question: “Did Jesus rise from the dead?”3


           THE MINIMAL FACTS APPROACH
           That night, Mike was advancing an argument pioneered by his friend
           Gary, called the Minimal Facts Approach. The advantages to the argu-
           ment are that it is powerful, easy to understand, and so simple that it can
           be stated in one sentence: There are historical facts surrounding Jesus’
           crucifixion that virtually all historians agree upon, and by far the best
           explanation of those facts is that Jesus rose from the dead.
               To provide some background, Gary had spent thirty years catalogu-
           ing the positions of historical Jesus scholars, whether agnostic, atheist,
           Jewish, Christian, or any other worldview. He read everything published
           about the historical Jesus in scholarly journals and monographs written
           in French, English, or German. He noticed that, on some matters, well
           over 90 percent of scholars were unanimous.4 While considering those
           facts, he realized that they were best explained by Jesus’ resurrection.
           By far. Every other explanation either ignored or strained the historical
           facts surrounding Jesus’ death.
               Truly, when we consider the task of the historian, it is to do exactly
           that: provide a narrative model that makes the best sense of the histor-
           ical records. In this case, the only model that really fits the facts is that
           Jesus rose from the dead.
               Taking the list of facts from Gary, Mike has since whittled it down
           to three, which we will briefly explore now:

                 1. Jesus died by crucifixion
                 2. Jesus’ followers truly believed the risen Jesus had appeared to them
                 3. People who were not followers of Jesus truly believed the risen
                    Jesus had appeared to them

               Fact 1: Jesus died by crucifixion. The previous chapter explored Jesus’
           death by crucifixion in detail. More than any other matter concerning
           Jesus, historians remain convinced that Jesus’ death is a fact of history.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 188                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                     The Positive Case   189

                   Fact 2: Jesus’ followers truly believed the risen Jesus appeared to them.
              Historians are also convinced that Jesus’ followers came to believe that
              they had seen the risen Jesus. Their reasons are manifold.
                   First, the proclamation appears extremely early in church history.
              First Corinthians 15:3–7, the “news flash” Christian creed that reported
              Jesus’ death within a few years of his crucifixion, also contains a formu-
              lation of the people to whom he appeared. It reports “that Christ died
              for our sins according to the Scriptures, he was buried, he was raised on
              the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter,
              then to the Twelve, then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at
              the same time, of whom most remain until now, though some have fallen
              asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.”
                   According to the acclaimed and respected scholar James Dunn, “This
              tradition, we can be entirely confident, was formulated as tradition within
              months of Jesus’ death.”5 The teachings that the very first Christians
              chose to formulate into creeds and pass on to one another included a list
              of people to whom the risen Jesus appeared. Not only is Peter first in this
              list, essentially hanging the proclamation on his authority, but also the list
              says that Jesus appeared to five hundred people at once.
                   Second, the proclamation of Jesus’ resurrection invites verification
              from eyewitnesses. For example, while reporting the above creed about
              twenty years after Jesus’ death, Paul says that most of the five hundred
              eyewitnesses are still alive, as if to say, “If you want to talk to the eye-
              witnesses of the risen Jesus, there are over 250 to choose from!”
                   This follows the pattern we find reported in Acts 10:40–41, where
              Peter emphasizes they were eyewitnesses: “God raised him from the
              dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by
              all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—­by us
              who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead” (NIV).6 Of
              course, Luke reports other accounts which emphasize that there were
              eyewitnesses of the risen Jesus, such as the very first proclamation of the
              gospel found in Acts 2:32, to which we have already referred: “God has
              raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it” (NIV). To Paul,
              Peter, and Luke, we can add John’s emphasis of being a witness to the
              risen Jesus as recorded in John 21:24.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 189                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

           190    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

               Third, the disciples were willing to die for their belief that the risen
           Jesus had appeared to them. Of course, being willing to die for a belief
           does not make that belief true, but it almost always ensures sincerity.
           People do not often give up their lives for what they know is wrong.
           In this case, the disciples were willing to die for something that they
           claimed to have personally seen: the risen Jesus. The martyrdoms of var-
           ious eyewitnesses are found in recorded history, starting with Stephen’s
           martyrdom (Acts 7:60) and including such high-­profile disciples as
           James the brother of John (Acts 12:2) and Peter himself (1 Clement
           5:2–7). Having seen Jesus conquer death, they no longer feared death
           as they had in the garden of Gethsemane. They truly believed Jesus
           was risen.
               For these three reasons and more, the vast majority of scholars are
           convinced that Jesus’ followers truly believed he had risen from the
           dead. Accordingly, A. J. M. Wedderburn has said, “It is an indubitable
           historical datum that sometime, somehow the disciples came to believe
           that they had seen the risen Jesus.”7
               Fact 3: People who were not Jesus’ followers truly believed the risen Jesus
           appeared to them. Finally, there were some who were not following Jesus
           that truly believed Jesus had appeared to them after rising from the
           dead. The first and foremost of these is Saul of Tarsus, also known as
           Paul. During Jesus’ lifetime, Paul was a student of Rabban Gamaliel
           who was one of the tannaim, the most influential teachers of the oral
           Torah in history. According to tradition, Gamaliel was the grandson of
           the great Jewish teacher Hillel, the eponymous founder of the school of
           Jewish thought known as the House of Hillel. With such a noble Jewish
           pedigree, Paul began persecuting Christians, having the authority and
           zeal to arrest them and even preside over their executions.
               Yet something happened to Paul which led him to join those he per-
           secuted, even giving up his high Jewish rank and position. According to
           Paul, the risen Jesus appeared to him. In the book of Acts, Luke records
           Paul sharing his testimony three times, where he makes it clear that he
           converted on account of having seen the risen Jesus. Paul testifies of this
           reason himself in 1 Corinthians 15. For his proclamation that Jesus had
           risen from the dead, he was flogged with lashes five times, beaten with

                                                                   The Positive Case   191

              rods three times, stoned until assumed dead, and ultimately beheaded.8
              Paul had many chances to change his mind or repent, but he gave up
              everything, including his life, testifying that he had personally seen the
              risen Jesus.
                  Another key figure that denied Jesus during his life but followed him
              after the crucifixion is James the brother of Jesus. In Mark’s gospel we
              find Jesus’ brothers coming to collect Jesus because they thought he was
              “out of his mind” (3:21, 31 NIV), and in John’s gospel, Jesus’ brothers
              taunt him such that the gospel says “not even his brothers believed him”
              (7:3–5 NIV). Even as Jesus was being crucified, his brothers did not
              come to support him, such that their mother Mary had to be entrusted
              to John’s care (John 19:26–27). But then, after Jesus’ crucifixion, we
              see his brothers counted among the believers (Acts 1:14). The creed in
              1 Corinthians 15 tells us why: The risen Jesus appeared to James (v. 7),
              who then became a leader of the church in Jerusalem (Gal. 1:19) before
              being executed by Ananus ben Ananus. Four ancient sources report the
              execution of James the brother of Jesus, including the Jewish historian
              Josephus.9
                  So in addition to the disciples, Paul and James—­men who were
              not following Jesus during his lifetime—­gave their lives on account of
              having seen the risen Jesus.10 The self-­described “liberal, modern, sec-
              ularized”11 scholar E. P. Sanders says, “That Jesus’ followers, and later
              Paul, had resurrection experiences is, in my judgment, a fact.”12 David
              Catchpole, emeritus professor at the University of Exeter, adds, “The
              appearance to James was . . . not one that could work from an already
              existing sympathy or commitment. In that respect it was not dissim-
              ilar to what happened later to Paul.”13 To this, scholars Shanks and
              Witherington add, “It appears that James, like Paul, was a convert to
              the Jesus movement because at some juncture he saw the risen Jesus, for
              nothing prior to Easter can explain his having become such a follower
              of Jesus, much less a leader of Jesus’ followers.”14

           192    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?


           FROM FACTS TO ARGUMENT
           Let us now summarize the minimal facts. When considering the life of
           Jesus, we can be very confident of these three conclusions: Jesus died by
           crucifixion; Jesus’ followers truly believed the risen Jesus appeared to
           them; and people who were not Jesus’ followers truly believed the risen
           Jesus appeared to them.
               Given that the task of a historian is to provide a narrative model
           that makes the best sense of the historical records, what is the best his-
           torical conclusion regarding Jesus’ life? According to the Minimal Facts
           Approach, the best explanation of the facts, by far, is that Jesus actually
           rose from the dead. Every other explanation ignores or strains the facts
           too much to be plausible.
               For example, one of the more common alternative hypotheses is that
           the disciples hallucinated Jesus’ resurrection. It is a well-­k nown medical
           phenomenon that people recently bereaved of loved ones may halluci-
           nate their presence. Could it be that the disciples, having spent years
           following Jesus and trusting deeply that he would be their Messiah, were
           so desperate to see Jesus again that they hallucinated his return?
               Jesus’ death by crucifixion (fact 1) certainly can fit in this theory,
           but does the fact that Jesus’ followers truly believed they had seen the
           risen Jesus (fact 2) fit? When we consider that he appeared first to Peter,
           then to the twelve, and then to five hundred people at once, followed by
           James, it seems hard to account for all these appearances as bereavement
           hallucinations. There certainly is no medical parallel for five hundred
           people having the same bereavement hallucination at the same time. For
           that reason alone, this hypothesis is highly unlikely. Even if there were
           an unprecedented five hundred people who had bereavement hallucina-
           tions, it seems unlikely that every one of them would be convinced they
           saw Jesus himself instead of a passing dream.
               But for the sake of the argument, let us assume that the halluci-
           nation hypothesis accounts for fact 2: his disciples truly believed they
           had seen him risen, but what they actually saw was a hallucination.
           Even giving that hypothesis the benefit of the doubt, it simply does not
           account for fact 3: People who did not follow Jesus truly believed he had




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 192                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                     The Positive Case   193

              appeared to them. Paul does not fit the psychological profile of one who
              would hallucinate the return of Jesus. He had no emotional attachment
              to Jesus and no hopes vested in him, and Paul had everything to lose.
              Why would Paul have hallucinated the risen Jesus? It simply does not fit.
                  Thus the hallucination hypothesis strains fact 2 and does not fit
              fact 3. It is not a likely hypothesis.
                  Another theory is that Jesus’ body was stolen by the disciples, and
              that they promulgated the message of a resurrected Jesus to vindicate
              their maligned Messiah, though it was a hoax. Fact 1, Jesus’ death, fits
              into this hypothesis, but fact 2 does not: The disciples truly did believe
              they had seen the risen Jesus. It is not likely that Peter and James and
              Stephen and others would have died for a known lie, and certainly not
              so willingly. Of course, the same can be said of fact 3. Paul and James,
              men who had not followed Jesus during his life, would have no reason
              to perpetrate this hoax.
                  The stolen body hypothesis fits neither fact 2 nor fact 3. It is not a
              likely hypothesis.
                  The common Muslim response, as we saw in the previous chapter,
              is that Jesus did not die on the cross. That theory accounts for facts 2
              and 3, but it is a direct contradiction of fact 1: that Jesus died by cruci-
              fixion. To posit this hypothesis is, again, to go against the facts.
                  The Swoon Theory does not fit fact 1. It is not a likely hypothesis.
                  The hypothesis that fits all the facts, and fits them very well, is
              exactly what the disciples were proclaiming, along with others who were
              not disciples: Jesus rose from the dead. It is the only explanation that fits
              the puzzle pieces together.
                  The resurrection hypothesis accounts for facts 1, 2, and 3. Since it
              is the one and only hypothesis that explains the historical facts without
              straining or ignoring them, an objective observer ought to conclude that
              Jesus’ resurrection is by far the best explanation of the data.


              MIRACLES AND THE OBJECTIVE OBSERVER
              At this point, most non-­Christian scholars of the historical Jesus follow
              Sanders in saying, “What the reality was that gave rise to the experiences




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 193                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

           194    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

           I do not know.”15 Since there is no probable naturalistic explanation, they
           do not suggest one. That is responsible enough, except that it imposes
           a naturalist bias—­that we cannot conclude a miracle has happened. I
           would argue that an objective investigator should not have such a bias.
           We must be open to the idea but be very cautious, not readily jumping
           to the explanation of a miracle.
                It is important to note that in the previous chapter I said, “An
           objective observer should not conclude that a miracle has occurred
           unless there is no other probable explanation, and even then only in
           special circumstances.” In the case of the resurrection of Jesus, unlike
           the Substitution Theory or the Theistic Swoon Theory, there is no
           other probable explanation. All other conclusions strain credulity. Even
           though that is the case, it is still not enough for an objective observer
           to conclude a miracle has happened. We need special circumstances;
           specifically, we need a context charged with supernatural expectation.
                For example, let us imagine that a blind man who is rummaging
           through a cupboard above his head accidentally knocks over a bottle,
           spilling its contents. Oil pours over his head. As he wipes it away, he finds
           that he can see again. Should he conclude that a miracle has occurred? I
           would argue that he should not. Although something extraordinary and
           inexplicable has happened, one should not automatically conclude that
           all extraordinary and inexplicable occurrences are miracles.
                Now imagine that the same blind man has prayed faithfully for
           years that his sight be restored. While praying one day, he is convinced
           that God is leading him to go to a stranger’s home. After arguing with
           himself aloud because he has never heard God speak before, he decides
           he has nothing to lose, and he makes his way to that home and knocks
           on the door. The owner of the home comes to the door, and as the man
           fumbles with words to explain who he is, the owner says, “You don’t have
           to tell us who you are. Just now my family and I were praying together,
           and we had a strong intuition that God was sending a blind man to us
           for healing, and that we were to pray for his sight to be restored and to
           anoint his head with oil.” The blind man is seated, and as the family
           prays for his sight to be restored, they anoint him for healing. Oil pours
           over his head. As he wipes it away, he finds that he can see again.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 194                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                    The Positive Case   195

                  In this latter scenario, should the blind man conclude that a miracle
              has occurred? I would argue that, in the latter case, he is justified in
              concluding that a miracle has occurred. Even though the physical act
              is the same in both scenarios—­oil pouring over his head—­the latter
              scenario is charged with supernatural expectation. On account of the
              context, it is not unreasonable to conclude he has experienced a miracle.
                  Furthermore, if the circumstances can be verified by an investigator,
              the investigator also ought to conclude that a miracle has occurred. Let
              us imagine that the man’s praying and arguing with God were caught
              on surveillance video, as were the family’s prayer session and anointing
              with oil, with the result that the blind man can now see. Not only can
              an objective investigator responsibly conclude that a miracle has hap-
              pened, it is his duty to do so. Otherwise, he is not being objective but is
              importing a naturalist bias.
                  In the same way, if something extraordinary and inexplicable has
              happened in history, and that extraordinary event is charged with super-
              natural expectation, and there are solid historical facts surrounding the
              event that have no other probable explanation, a historian can reasona-
              bly conclude that a miracle has indeed happened.


              CONCLUSION
              As a Muslim observing Mike’s debate, I had to agree that if Jesus really
              did die on the cross, there was excellent reason to believe he rose from the
              dead. Historically speaking, the three facts are indisputable: Jesus died by
              crucifixion, his disciples truly believed they had seen him risen, and even
              men who were not his disciples truly believed they had seen him risen.
              Nothing accounts for these facts without strain apart from the resurrec-
              tion hypothesis, and even as objective observers, the spiritually charged
              context allows us to conclude that a miracle has happened. Along with
              the early church, history testifies that Jesus rose from the dead.
                  But despite what history indicated, I was not yet convinced Jesus actu-
              ally died on the cross. There was one other matter that I and the Muslim
              world around me found not just problematic but highly offensive.

                       THE ISLAMIC RESPONSE
                                        ALL PAUL’S FAULT




           A     fter Mike presented the minimal facts for Jesus’ resurrection, Shabir
                 Ally took the stage to defend the Islamic stance. He responded
           primarily by challenging fact 1, asserting that we cannot be sure Jesus
           died by crucifixion. Not only was this an understandable response on
           account of 4.157 of the Quran, but it was actually the expected response.
           Muslims are normally less concerned with the supernatural implications
           of the resurrection than with the physical death of Jesus in the first place.
                Part of the reason why is because, along with Christians, most
           Muslims believe in Jesus’ ascension. Immediately after denying Jesus’
           death on the cross, the Quran says in 4.158, “Rather, Allah raised him
           toward himself.” On account of this belief, the average Muslim does not
           immediately conceive of the resurrection as a problem, usually assuming
           it to be a corollary of the Christian misunderstanding that Jesus died
           on the cross. According to the average Muslim, yes, Jesus was raised to
           heaven, but no, he did not first die on the cross. It was not a resurrection
           but an ascension.
                For these reasons, of the hundreds of Muslim-­Christian dialogues I
           have seen and taken part in, first as a Muslim and then as a Christian,
           Muslims make a robust effort to challenge Jesus’ death but generally
           leave the rest of the case for the resurrection untouched. Apart from
           what was discussed in chapter 22, there is no common response to the
           arguments for the resurrection, with one significant exception.



           196

                                                                The Islamic Response   197


              MUSLIMS AND PAUL
              Since the Quran teaches that Jesus was a prophet and that his follow-
              ers were righteous men, we regarded Jesus’ disciples with high esteem.
              According to 3.52, the disciples answered Jesus’ call to righteously fol-
              low Allah, and in 3.55, Allah promises to exalt Jesus’ followers, making
              them superior to others until the Day of Resurrection.1
                  That said, Muslims today recognize that Christian teachings are
              diametrically opposed to Islamic doctrine. Christianity teaches that
              God became a man and died on the cross for our sins—­doctrines that
              Muslims consider inconceivable and blasphemous. So, from our perspec-
              tive as a Muslim community, Christian teachings had been corrupted.
                  But when were they corrupted? When we trace these beliefs back,
              we find that they were the beliefs of the earliest church. Therefore,
              Muslims have to believe that somehow, during the time of the disciples
              themselves, the early church was infiltrated and its message corrupted.
              This had to be the work of someone powerful, someone other than the
              disciples.
                  There is only one obvious figure who fits that description: Paul.
                  It is for this reason that Paul’s motives, character, and authority are
              called into question. It was Paul who took the religion taught by Jesus
              and turned it into the religion about Jesus. In the debate with Mike,
              Shabir Ally described mainstream Christianity as a Pauline invention.
              “Later Christianity would follow the line of Paul,” argues Ally. “There
              was tension between Paul and the original disciples of Jesus and the
              family of Jesus, so Paul was celebrated and the family and disciples of
              Jesus were denigrated.” Ally implies that the disagreements Paul had
              with Peter and James are evidence of a schism in early Christianity
              wherein the Pauline version ultimately won.
                  A second common and important argument is that Jesus told his
              disciples to follow the Law, whereas Paul said the Law has been abol-
              ished. The evidence for this position is found by highlighting Matthew
              5:17, in which Jesus says, “Do not think that I have come to abolish
              the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill
              them” (NIV). This verse seems to imply that Jesus has come to uphold




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 197                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           198    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

           the Law, but Paul says in Romans 3:28, “For we maintain that a person
           is justified by faith apart from the works of the law” (NIV). Therefore,
           Muslims say Paul contradicts Jesus.
                There are many other common challenges to Paul that Muslims
           suggest, but the third and final one we will cover here is one of the most
           significant. Muslims often argue that Paul never saw Jesus, and that he
           rarely comments on the historical Jesus in his letters. Therefore, Paul
           must not have been concerned about who Jesus actually was, but rather
           was interested in turning Jesus into the Son of God, even God himself.
                This has been but a quick foray into the reasons why Muslims dis-
           trust Paul and consider him to be the corrupter of true Christianity
           and the founder of the blasphemous religion that worships a man and
           ignores God’s law—­that is, today’s mainstream Christianity. This view
           is espoused by Muslim apologists and imams worldwide, and it filters
           down unabated to the average Muslim, as it did to me. In truth, almost
           every single Muslim-­Christian conversation about early Christianity
           I have heard comes to a gridlock on the person of Paul. It is hard to
           exaggerate how much Muslims distrust Paul and how much they hold
           him accountable for the shape of Christianity today.


           CONCLUSION OF THE ISLAMIC RESPONSE
           TO THE RESURRECTION
           Not only do Muslims disagree that Jesus actually died on the cross,
           they consider the entire foundation of Christianity to be questionable
           because a man who was not a disciple and who never even saw Jesus
           successfully infiltrated the ranks and hijacked the early church. The
           religion taught by Jesus became the religion about Jesus, and what was
           a religion about following God’s law and worshiping God alone became
           a religion that ignored the law and worshiped a man alongside God.
           Though Christianity originally looked much more like Islam, it has
           been lost forever because of Paul.

                                    IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE




              T    o be fair, the Muslim challenge to Paul is not entirely unwarranted.
                   He is a very surprising character in the early church with an equally
              surprising degree of influence. Can we really trust Paul? If Paul never
              met Jesus before the crucifixion, how could he accurately relay the reli-
              gion taught by Jesus? Might today’s Christianity be a Pauline product?
                  This question became a popular one in academic circles during
              the 1980s, and a few Western scholars even answered it affirmatively.
              Perhaps the most notable such response was by the Jewish scholar and
              dramatist Hyam Maccoby in his 1986 book, The Mythmaker: Paul and
              the Invention of Christianity. Maccoby goes as far as saying it was Paul
              who founded Christianity.1 Arguments similar to his were popular-
              ized by the equally idiosyncratic Karen Armstrong, a favorite of many
              Muslim apologists, who said, “Paul has not only been an important
              influence on Christianity, but . . . in a very real sense he was its founder.
              He could be called the first Christian.”2
                  On account of efforts such as theirs, this view became a hot topic
              of discussion in university forums, but the dust settled quickly and the
              victory was decisive: Paul remained a follower of Christ, not the founder
              of Christianity. The scholarly consensus has remained firm ever since.3
                  With all this in mind, it goes without saying that this is a good
              question that deserves much more space to cover than we have here, so

                                                                                       199

           200    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

           we will answer the question of Paul broadly and briefly. After that we
           will consider the particular problem that this challenge to Paul causes
           for the Islamic view of Jesus’s disciples before finally recentering this
           discussion on Jesus’ resurrection.


           EXAMINING PAUL
           Part of the reason why almost no scholar today agrees with the common
           Muslim characterization of Paul is that it depicts him as a usurping
           deceiver. I recall an imam at our mosque teaching us that Paul saw a
           power vacuum among the disciples after Jesus died, so he infiltrated
           the church and climbed the ranks to take over the reins. The problem
           with this portrayal is obvious to those who know Paul’s background: He
           was far more secure in his power as a student of Gamaliel, in the line of
           Hillel, than he would have been in the persecuted church. He already
           had the authority to arrest heretics and preside over executions, and
           his power would only have grown. Instead he chose the meek life of a
           persecuted man who labored for his wages (Acts 18:3).
                That Islamic portrayal of Paul as a deceiver is also doubtful because
           Paul was sincere enough to die for his faith. The record of his martyrdom
           comes within a few years of his beheading, and scholars do not doubt
           it.4 As we explored before, people willing to go to their deaths for their
           beliefs may very well be mistaken, but they are almost certainly sincere.
           According to the records, Paul was lashed five times, beaten with rods
           three times, and even stoned until assumed dead before he was ulti-
           mately executed (2 Cor. 11:24–25). If he were simply deceiving people,
           he had ten opportunities to repent before receiving life-­threatening
           punishments. Would he not have given up the charade? What was there
           to gain by deceiving everyone if he was about to lose his life? In truth,
           Paul gave up power, prestige, personal safety, and even his life. He did
           not receive any material gain by following Jesus.

           Paul, the Jewish Law, and the Authority of the Disciples
              It is true that Paul had an argument with Peter, as recorded in
           Galatians 2:11–14, but it is important to read the context. Paul informs




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 200                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

              us that shortly after his conversion, he went to Peter and stayed with
              him for fifteen days. After sitting under Peter and at times James the
              brother of Jesus, Paul went from city to city proclaiming the gospel for
              fourteen years. Then, to make sure he was still preaching according to
              the disciples’ teaching, he traveled back to Jerusalem and submitted his
              preaching to the disciples. After hearing him, Peter, James, and John gave
              him their approval and sent him on his way back to Antioch saying that
              he should preach to the Gentiles while they preached to the Jews in
              Jerusalem. All the while, Paul refers to the disciples as “pillars” of the
              church and those of “high esteem” (Gal. 2:6, 9 NIV).
                  The argument only occurs when Peter was placed in a new situation
              and, so as not to offend some people, he acted with double standards.
              Leaving Jerusalem, where he was a preacher to the Jews and the church
              was full of believers from Jewish backgrounds, Peter traveled to Antioch
              in Syria, “the headquarters of Gentile Christianity.”5 Although the law
              of the Jews forbade them from eating with Gentiles, Peter was will-
              ing to eat with the Gentiles because he no longer considered the law
              binding (Gal. 2:12; cf. Acts 10; 15:10–11). But when believers from a
              Jewish background came to Antioch from Jerusalem,6 Peter did not
              want to offend them, so he stopped eating with the Gentiles. This,
              understandably, caused problems in Antioch, and Paul corrected Peter
              for his double standard.7
                  Virtually none of this account fits with the common Muslim
              characterization of Paul. It was Paul who first went to Peter and stayed
              with him and James. Later, Paul submitted what he was teaching to
              the disciples and continued preaching only when he received their
              approval. These are not the actions of someone who is trying to subvert
              the church, but rather those of a man who is submitting himself to the
              authority of the disciples.
                  When it comes to the Jewish law, it was Peter who gave his approval
              for Paul to be a minister to the Gentiles, and it was Peter who did
              not consider Christians to be under the law, such that he ate with the
              Gentiles. The only measure that Paul used to argue with Peter was Peter
              himself: Peter had been willing to eat with the Gentiles at one time
              but refused to do so at another. Paul never attempted to invoke any




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 201                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           202    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

           authority over Peter but questioned Peter by his own standards: “If you,
           being a Jew, live like Gentiles and not like Jews, how can you compel the
           Gentiles to live like Jews?” (Gal. 2:14).
               According to the book of Acts, it was Peter himself who inaugurated
           the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles. The tenth chapter of Acts
           shares the story of Peter’s receiving a vision to preach to the Gentiles and
           then being led by God to Caesarea to do exactly that. While preaching
           to Cornelius and those with him, Peter says, “You are well aware that it
           is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God
           has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean” (Acts
           10:28 NIV). It was this encounter that Peter invoked in Acts 15:7–11
           when Peter himself suggested that Gentiles not be bound by the law.8
               So Paul does not rebel against Peter and James. Rather, he submits
           to their authority. When there is need to correct Peter, Paul does not
           dare invoke his own authority but reminds Peter of his own standards.
           Finally, Paul is not the one who absolves Gentiles of following the law;
           that is Peter, the very disciple who ushered in the era of evangelizing
           the Gentiles.

           Jesus Came to Fulfill the Law
               So if Peter and Paul are in agreement that people are not bound by
           the law, what should we make of Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:17 when he
           says, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets;
           I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them” (NIV)? Does this
           mean that Jesus has come to follow the Law and expects his followers
           to do the same?
               The first thing to note is Jesus says he has come to “fulfill” the
           Law and the Prophets. Not “follow” but “fulfill.” The Greek word here,
           pleroo, has the senses of fullness and bringing to an end, just as the word
           fulfill does in English. When someone fulfills something, it is finished
           and one is no longer bound to it. For example, if we take a loan, we are
           bound to make regular payments, but once we have fulfilled our loan,
           having paid it in full, our payments are brought to an end. In the same
           sense, Jesus is saying, “I am not cancelling the Law and the Prophets; I
           am their fulfillment, bringing them to their completion and finishing




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 202                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                      Assessing the Islamic Response   203

              them.” To say that “fulfilling” the Law and the Prophets means to “fol-
              low” the Jewish law is to misunderstand the verbiage of Matthew 5:17
              and to miss its meaning.
                  Secondly, when Jews referred to the Law and the Prophets in this
              way, they were referring to the books of the Old Testament, not the
              commandments of the Jewish law. Remember, the Hebrew Bible is
              composed of the Law and the Prophets and the Writings. So Jesus is
              here saying he has come to fulfill the Old Testament, not to follow
              commandments.
                  Drawing these insights together, we can understand the verse more
              correctly: Jesus is saying that the Old Testament finds its completion in
              him. He is not abolishing it but completing it. The Old Testament is
              being fulfilled because Jesus has come.
                  There is more to say about these rich verses, especially since the
              verses immediately following Matthew 5:17 are sometimes thought to
              enforce the notion that Jesus expected people to follow the Jewish law. A
              careful reading shows that is not the case.9 It should also be noted that
              in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches some ethics that go directly
              against Jewish law, such as not taking oaths.10 Elsewhere in Matthew,
              Jesus says a few times that he has come to bring something new, not to
              simply follow the old (Matt. 9:16–17; 13:52).
                  So Peter’s teaching that people are not bound by the law are teach-
              ings that Paul consistently applied to the Gentiles, and they are entirely
              compatible with Jesus’ message.

              Paul and the Historical Jesus
                  The last challenge concerning Paul that we will cover is the assertion
              that Paul, never having seen Jesus, was less concerned with the histor-
              ical Jesus than he was in turning Jesus into the Son of God, even God
              himself.
                  Although commonly assumed, it is not certain that Paul never saw
              Jesus during Jesus’ earthly ministry, because this is a conclusion mostly
              based on silence.11 It is true that Paul does not often talk about the
              historical Jesus in the New Testament. But this does not mean he was
              unconcerned with the life of Jesus. After seeing the risen Jesus, Paul




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 203                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           204    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

           went to visit Peter for fifteen days (Gal. 1:18). What are we to assume
           Paul and Peter did during those two weeks? As the scholar C. H. Dodd
           famously put it, “We may presume they did not spend all the time talking
           about the weather.”12 Paul learned about the historical Jesus while sitting
           under the authority of Peter. In fact, the word Paul uses for his meeting
           with Peter is historeo, the very Greek word from which the English word
           history derives. He was keenly interested in the historical Jesus.
               So why do we not see Paul talking more about Jesus’ life in his let-
           ters? In fact, he does talk about the historical Jesus, most notably in the
           book of 1 Corinthians where he paraphrases Jesus’ words or discusses
           Jesus’ life a total of six times.13 In addition, some of the accounts Paul
           relays about Jesus’ life indicate that he knew much more that he did
           not say in his letters, such as the words “on the night he was betrayed”
           (1 Cor. 11:23 NIV). One could hardly imagine that Paul would say
           these words without knowing what actually did happen on the night
           Jesus was betrayed. Yet Paul never actually talks about the details in
           his letters.
               Which leads to the second, more important point: Letters are not
           meant to be comprehensive, especially letters between close relations. I
           have written fewer than a dozen letters to my wife, and if people were
           to read those letters assuming they contained everything I ever wanted
           to tell her, they would be sorely disappointed. I have a strong relation-
           ship with my wife, and we talk with each other for hours every day.
           What has been said in person will go unsaid in written communication,
           and usually only emergent matters are stated in letters, while the most
           established matters have already been stated in person. In the same way,
           Paul personally knew those to whom he wrote his letters, and he spent
           weeks, at times years, in their company. To expect something different
           of Paul’s letters is to burden them with unrealistic expectations.14
               So we can conclude Paul was very much interested in the actual life
           of Jesus, not just the theological Jesus. The question of whether Paul
           turned Jesus into the Son of God, or perhaps even God himself, will be
           explored more fully in the next chapter.

              Summarizing Paul
                  There is little reason to doubt Paul’s sincerity. He received his
              teaching from Peter, and he submitted to Peter’s authority. He followed
              Peter in teaching that the Gentiles did not need to follow the law, a
              corollary of Jesus’ teaching implicit in Matthew 5:17. Even though Paul
              did not know Jesus during Jesus’ ministry, we can be confident that Paul
              learned about the historical Jesus from Peter and knew much that he
              did not mention in his letters. The common Muslim assertion that Paul
              hijacked Christianity, imposed his own teachings, and corrupted the
              true religion not only goes against the biblical records but also is unwar-
              ranted from a historical point of view and enjoys very little scholarly
              support.
                  But beyond this, there is a theological problem for Muslims who
              would argue that Paul corrupted Christianity.


              THE PROBLEM WITH THE ISLAMIC VIEW OF PAUL
              The common Muslim view of Paul has significant problems even when
              considered from an Islamic perspective. First, what happened to the
              disciples? How were they so easily overcome by Paul that either they
              were convinced by his trickery and followed him, or their voices were
              completely drowned out and there is no record of their dissent? Was this
              outsider that much more powerful than Jesus that he was able to undo
              all of Jesus’ work and teachings? As a Muslim, I never provided a model
              as to how this might have occurred, and I have never heard one after
              leaving Islam.
                   The problem becomes sharper when we revisit one of the Quranic
              verses that makes a promise to Jesus: “Indeed, I will cleanse you (Jesus)
              from those who disbelieve, and I will make those who follow you supe-
              rior to those who disbelieve, until the day of resurrection” (3.55).15 Allah
              promises to make the disciples superior to disbelievers, and Jesus would
              be made free from such disbelievers. The Muslim view of Paul, that he
              overcame the disciples and hijacked Jesus’ message, seems to ignore the
              Quran’s promise to the disciples.

           206    Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?

               It would be helpful if the Quran had something to say about Paul,
           but it says absolutely nothing, never so much as mentioning his name.
           Given the pivotal role Muslims often think Paul had in corrupting
           Christianity, the silence is deafening. Why does the Quran not mention
           him? Is it on account of the Quran’s omission that Muslims in the early
           and classical periods of Islam, such as Tabari and Qurtubi, saw Paul as
           a follower of Jesus?16
               In US criminal law, as in other places around the world, three
           aspects of a crime must be established before a suspect can be found
           guilty: a means, a motive, and an opportunity. The Islamic view that
           Paul hijacked Christianity fails to secure any of these three. Paul could
           not have had the means because Allah promised to make the disciples
           insuperable; there is no viable motive for Paul to deceive the church as
           his efforts earned him only persecution and a death sentence; and there
           is no model suggested that clarifies how Paul might have had an oppor-
           tunity to overcome all the disciples and hijack the church. Of course,
           not only should Paul be considered innocent until proven guilty, but
           as far as this investigation is concerned, there simply is no evidence to
           convict him. Case closed.


           RECENTERING ON THE RESURRECTION
           Finally, let us return to the original question: Did Jesus rise from the dead?
           The truth is, even if we disregard Paul entirely, we still have good reason
           to think Jesus rose from the dead. The disciples preached Jesus’ resurrec-
           tion many times in the book of Acts, and their conviction that Jesus rose
           from the dead is the best explanation for their transformation from fear-
           ful followers in the garden of Gethsemane to bold martyrs at the hands
           of the Romans and others. They no longer feared death because Jesus had
           defeated death. The same is true for James, Jesus’ unbelieving brother,
           who was willing to pay the ultimate price after seeing the risen Jesus.
           These records are found in the Gospels, the book of Acts, the Johannine
           epistles, 1 Peter, Hebrews, 1 Clement, Josephus, and elsewhere. In order
           to effectively argue against the resurrection from an Islamic perspective,
           one would have to do more than just discredit the Pauline accounts.

                                                      Assessing the Islamic Response   207

                  Jesus’ resurrection encompassed the disciples. It was their initial
              catalyst, their core message, their driving conviction, and their ultimate
              hope. To deny this through an Islamic perspective, one which respects
              Jesus and the disciples as men of God, is to overlook everything we
              know about the inception of the church.

                                            Chapter 28



                                      CONCLUSION
                              JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD




           A     t the end of the debate, my friend David and I discussed what
                 we thought of the Christian defense of the resurrection and the
           Islamic critique. We ended up sitting in his car for a few hours in the
           parking lot, processing thoughts and mulling over the arguments. There
           was no question in my mind that Shabir Ally was the more polished
           speaker and the better debater, and that he did an excellent job of win-
           ning over the crowd.
               But when I considered the arguments carefully, even as a Muslim, I
           had to conclude that Mike’s Minimal Facts Approach was more compel-
           ling than Shabir’s critique. History certainly seemed to testify that Jesus
           died by crucifixion, that his followers then honestly believed they had
           seen him risen, and that even some who were not his followers honestly
           believed they had seen him risen. Mike suggested that the best explana-
           tion for these historical facts was that Jesus rose from the dead.
               Shabir did not suggest a better alternative. Rather, Shabir tried to dis-
           card data that did not fit the Islamic perspective: Jesus’ death and Paul’s
           reliability. When we consider the arguments that Muslims commonly
           use to discredit Paul’s testimony, we find that they are very problematic.
           There is no reason to think that Paul was insincere; the evidence indi-
           cates that he submitted to the authority of the disciples, that Peter was
           the one who suggested new Christians not be bound to the Law; and
           it was indeed Peter, James, and John who extended their hand to Paul
           in his ministry to the Gentiles. The common Islamic characterization
           of Paul as the one who hijacked Christianity not only ignores Allah’s

           208




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 208                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                        Conclusion   209

              promises in the Quran but also fails to provide a motive or a means for
              Paul’s corruption of the church, and it requires a wholesale disregard for
              the records of the early church’s history.
                  So when answering the question I had set out for myself, “Would
              an objective observer conclude that Jesus rose from the dead?” I had to
              admit that Jesus’ resurrection was indeed the best explanation of the
              historical facts. Mike’s explanation of the evidence was much more con-
              vincing than Shabir’s selective rejection of the evidence.
                  But just as when I had investigated Jesus’ death, my conclusion did
              not compel me to leave Islam. I believed that my Islamic faith would be
              vindicated by other means, and that the Christian faith still had at least
              one fatal flaw: Jesus never claimed to be God.
                  This, for me, was the critical point. As far as I was concerned,
              Jesus’ death and resurrection were important matters to investigate, but
              whether Jesus claimed to be God was the real game changer. I was ready
              to pull out all the stops to defend my faith and prove that he did not.

                                            Chapter 29



                                THE POSITIVE CASE
                                    JESUS WAS ALWAYS GOD




              A     t no point is the schism between Christian and Islamic theologies
                    broader than on the person of Jesus. For Muslims, the doctrine
              of a divine Christ is anathema, and the Quran teaches that he who
              subscribes to it will make his home in the flames of hell (5:72). For
              the Christian, belief in the lordship of Christ is necessary for salvation
              (Rom. 10:9). What wider divergence could there be?
                   As a Muslim in the West, I very proudly saw myself as a real monothe-
              ist who respected Jesus appropriately. By contrast the Christians around
              me were, whether wittingly or unwittingly, blaspheming the one true
              God and insulting Jesus by deifying him. All other differences between
              Muslims and Christians were secondary to me, far less important than
              this most significant matter. In fact, I even boldly told Christians that
              Islam was superior to Christianity simply on account of this issue. “Islam
              is the true monotheism,” was the motto we heard at mosques.
                   The Quran informs Muslims that Jesus never claimed to be divine.
              Rather, people began to believe this after Jesus left the earth (5.116–117).
              So we believed that later Christians were responsible for corrupting the
              true Christianity. Learned men at our mosque told me that Roman
              paganism influenced Christian thought, as Roman gods often had sons
              who were demigods. Other Muslims argued that the Council of Nicaea
              was responsible for Jesus’ apotheosis, while yet others accused Paul of
              this blasphemy. Regardless of the exact model, most of us believed that
              the Bible did not even depict Jesus as God, and certainly Jesus never
              claimed to be God himself.

                                                                                      213

           214    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

               But did he? If we put aside our Islamic beliefs and ask the question
           as objective observers, will we conclude that Jesus claimed to be God?
           Based on my own experience, the answer is an arresting, revolutionizing
           yes. More than anything else, investigating this question has changed
           my life forever.
               My greatest opponent in discovering the answer was my own will. I
           did not want to see Jesus’ claim to deity in the pages of history, so I kept
           retreating and altering my position to avoid what was becoming more
           and more obvious. While I cannot trace all the points of this internal
           fencing competition, I will provide the conclusion of each major bout.


           DOES THE NEW TESTAMENT TEACH THAT JESUS IS GOD?
           At the outset, I was unsure whether the New Testament said anywhere
           that Jesus is God. I remember watching a Muslim speaker, Hamza
           Abdul Malik, challenge Christians by saying the teaching is not found
           anywhere in the Bible. But then I watched a debate between him and the
           Christian debater James White, and the matter was thoroughly settled:
           Apart from anything that could potentially be obscured, 2 Peter 1:1
           (NIV) calls Jesus “God and Savior,” as does Titus 2:13.1


           DO THE GOSPELS TEACH THAT JESUS IS GOD?—­
           JOHN’S GOSPEL
           Of course, Muslims owe no allegiance to the Bible as a whole, nor even
           the New Testament. The Quran says that the Injil was revealed as the
           Word of God, the gospel. I quickly staked my claim that, regardless of
           what the other books of the Bible said, Jesus is not God in the Gospels.
           It was then that my friend David pointed me to the gospel of John.
               There can be no doubt that Jesus is presented as divine in this
           Gospel. From the outset, John emphatically declares that Jesus is God,
           that he has always existed, and that he is the very means of all creation
           (1:1–3). Thus the first three verses of John’s gospel introduce Jesus as
           “God, the Eternal One through whom the universe was created.” John’s
           prologue concludes by calling Jesus “the only begotten God” (1:18).




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 214                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                    The Positive Case   215

                   As John’s gospel progresses, the Christology is unpacked and elabo-
              rated. Jesus is worthy of the honor due to God (5:23); he asks people to
              have faith in him as they have faith in God (14:1); he claims to be the
              enabler of salvation (5:21) and the earthly manifestation of God (14:8);
              he is the king of another world (18:36–37); he assumes dominion over
              all things (3:35); and he claims to be able to do whatever people ask in
              his name after he is gone, more or less implying that he has omniscience,
              omnipotence, and omnipresence (14:13). In addition, he admonishes his
              opponents that his identity is central to salvation (8:24) and that he
              perpetually preexists Abraham (8:58), in both of these cases using the
              divine name of Yahweh from the Old Testament, the “I Am.”2 In what
              some consider the climax of the gospel, a disciple realizes who he is
              and exclaims in affirmation, “My Lord and my God!”3 to which Jesus
              responds, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are
              those who have not seen and yet have believed” (20:28–29 NIV). The
              height of John’s gospel is a disciple proclaiming that Jesus is God, and
              Jesus’ commending his affirmation. From the first to the last, John’s
              gospel identifies Jesus as divine.4
                   This discovery was a jolt to my Islamic confidence. If Jesus actually
              claimed to be God, then the Quran was wrong about Jesus, which in
              turn meant that Islam was false. I could not concede this point, so I had
              to find a way out.


              DO THE GOSPELS TEACH THAT JESUS IS GOD?—­
              THE BEGINNING OF MARK’S GOSPEL
              After some research, I found that there was a famous scholar, Bart
              Ehrman, who was critical of Christianity and argued that John’s gospel
              was unreliable. “Jesus, beyond doubt in John’s gospel, is portrayed as
              divine,”5 remarks Ehrman; but because John was written sixty years
              after Jesus, it need not be accurate.6 The belief that Jesus was God was
              invented after his death, in the decades between Jesus and the writing
              of John’s gospel. That is why it is not found in the other gospels. If Jesus
              himself had claimed to be God, why do we have to wait until the fourth
              gospel to hear about it?




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 215                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           216    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

                That Jesus was deified after his death was what we believed as
           Muslims, and I found Islamic websites quoting Ehrman regularly. I
           decided to adopt his approach, arguing that, had Jesus actually claimed
           to be God, we would have found his deity taught in the first of the four
           gospels, Mark.7 So I set out to show David that Mark presented Jesus as
           just a man, not God, and I immersed myself in Mark’s gospel.
                The more I learned about Mark, the more I realized that it was a
           very Jewish gospel, written with the Old Testament in mind. It refers to
           Jewish sources over seventy times, with a strong preference for the book
           of Isaiah, and never once does it explicitly refer to a Graeco-­Roman
           source.8 When I read Mark through that lens, the lens of Hebrew
           Scripture, I realized that Ehrman was terribly mistaken. Not only does
           Mark present Jesus as divine, but the very point of Mark’s gospel is that
           Jesus is Yahweh.
                Mark starts with a reference to a passage in the Old Testament: Isaiah
           40:3–5. In that passage, “a voice calls out in the wilderness, ‘prepare the
           way for Yahweh! Make straight a highway in the desert for our God! . . .
           The Presence of Yahweh will appear.’ ” So Isaiah prophesies that Yahweh,
           the God of Israel, will appear, and a voice in the wilderness will proclaim
           his arrival. Mark tells us in 1:4 that John the Baptist is that voice in the
           wilderness, and the one whose arrival John proclaimed was Jesus. In
           other words, Mark equates Yahweh with Jesus, saying: We have been
           waiting for a man to proclaim the arrival of Yahweh, our God. John the
           Baptist is that man, and he has proclaimed the arrival of Jesus.
                In fact, Mark combines his reference to Isaiah 40:3–5 with Malachi
           3:1, where the text says explicitly that the messenger (again, John the
           Baptist) will appear before the Lord himself comes to his temple.9 As in
           the Isaiah reference, this equates the Lord with Jesus. For added empha-
           sis, the book of Malachi ends a few verses later by saying that if the
           Israelites do not accept the messenger, God himself will come.10
                Thus, at the very beginning of his gospel, Mark equates Yahweh
           with Jesus, using multiple Old Testament references. For the attentive
           Jewish reader, Mark’s prologue functions very much like John: It pro-
           claims that Jesus is God himself.
                Mark continues in 2:3–10, telling us that Jesus forgave a paralyzed




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 216                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                    The Positive Case   217

              man his sins. The Scribes at the scene thought to themselves, “He’s blas-
              pheming. Who can forgive sins but God alone?” (NIV). For the Jews,
              to blaspheme against God is an accusation that someone is not giving
              God his due respect, most commonly by saying the name Yahweh or
              by claiming divine status for oneself.11 Clearly, Jesus neither insulted
              God here nor uttered the divine name. Their charge of blasphemy can
              mean only that Jesus thought himself to be God by claiming the divine
              prerogative of forgiving sins.12
                  In response, far from denying that he claimed to be God, Jesus
              showed them his authority to forgive sins by healing the paralytic. Not
              only did this demonstrate his spiritual authority, but also it reminded
              the Scribes, who knew well the Hebrew Scriptures, of Psalm 103:2–3,
              which says, “O my soul, bless Yahweh and do not forget all his deeds!
              He is the one forgiving all your sins and healing all your diseases.”13 When
              Scribes charge Jesus with claiming to be God, instead of denying it,
              he goes even further by healing a paralytic, thereby doing what only
              Yahweh does in the Psalms.
                  Later in the same chapter, referring to himself, Jesus says, “The Son
              of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath” (Mark 2:28 NIV). Unless we know
              the Old Testament well, it is easy to miss the fact that the Sabbath is
              the fourth of the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:8). When Jesus refers
              to himself as Lord of the Sabbath, he is claiming lordship over the Ten
              Commandments, even though there is only one such Lord: Yahweh.
                  In Mark 4:35–41, we find the troubled disciples out on the water in
              the midst of a storm with waves so high they broke over the boat and
              began to flood it. Amid adversity they call out to Jesus. Jesus rebukes
              the wind and says to the waves, “Hush! Be calm!” whereupon the sea
              is calmed and waves are hushed (v. 39). The disciples ask themselves
              in amazement, “Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey
              him?” (v. 41). By now, we should realize that Mark expects us to answer
              these rhetorical questions by turning to the Old Testament. In Psalm
              107:25–30, men are on a stormy sea so perilous that their courage has
              melted and they are at their wits’ end. “Then they cried out to the
              Yahweh in their distress, and he brought them out of their troubles: He
              calmed the storm, and the waves were hushed” (vv. 28–29).

           218    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

               So in the Old Testament, when men are caught in a storm at sea and
           fearing death, they call out to Yahweh, who calms the storms and hushes
           the waves. In Mark, when the disciples are caught in a storm at sea and
           fearing death, they call out to Jesus, who calms the storms and hushes
           the waves. Once again, Mark equates Jesus with Yahweh.
               In another seafaring passage, Mark 6:45–52, the disciples are
           struggling to row against the wind. Amid the stormy waves, Jesus walks
           to them on the water. For those who know the Old Testament, the allu-
           sion is clear: In Job 9:8, when Job is speaking about Yahweh, he says,
           “He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea”
           (NIV). What Job says only Yahweh can do, Mark shows Jesus doing.
               Having discussed the highlights of Mark 1–6, we see Mark’s
           endeavor is clear: He portrays Jesus as Yahweh. But regardless of the
           clarity and multiple allusions, I was not yet convinced. What convinced
           me that Mark portrayed Jesus as Yahweh was the climax of the gospel—­
           Jesus’ trial.


           DO THE GOSPELS TEACH THAT JESUS IS GOD?—­
           THE CLIMAX OF MARK’S GOSPEL
           In Mark 14:55–64, Jesus has been brought before the high priest and
           the Sanhedrin. Those who brought Jesus to this trial have been seeking
           to destroy him since a time early in his ministry (3:6). They hope to
           incriminate him through his words against the temple, but without
           sufficient witnesses or a consistent accusation against him, the trial is
           going awry (14:55–59). Then the high priest stands and demands that
           Jesus tell them who he is. It appears the high priest hopes Jesus can be
           incriminated through his identity claims. When Jesus responds, he gives
           the Sanhedrin more than they hoped for.
               Jesus’ words are: “I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting at
           the right hand of the power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”
           The meaning of his words will not be clear to us if we do not know the
           Old Testament, but for the Jewish Sanhedrin, it was so clear that they
           condemned him to death for blasphemy. What exactly did Jesus say?
               In Mark 14:62, Jesus makes a twofold reference to the Old




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 218                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                  The Positive Case   219

              Testament, claiming the privileges and position of Yahweh for himself.
              The first reference is to Daniel. Jesus quotes Daniel 7:13–14, an apoca-
              lyptic vision of the prophet Daniel, which states, “In my vision at night
              I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with
              the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led
              into his presence. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all
              nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is
              an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one
              that will never be destroyed” (NIV).
                  In this passage from Daniel, a being who looks human (one like a
              son of man) approaches God. Although he looks human, his entrance
              is on clouds—­an entrance reserved for Yahweh in the Old Testament.14
              Then the one like a son of man is given everlasting dominion, glory,
              and a kingdom, even though only God is supposed to have dominion
              and glory in the everlasting kingdom. Finally, this passage says that
              all people will serve the Son of Man, but this word serve, whether in
              Aramaic or in Greek, always denotes a service due to God.
                  Thus, Daniel 7 introduces a son of man who rides the clouds, as only
              Yahweh can; he then receives everlasting dominion and glory over his
              own kingdom, as only Yahweh has; there, all people will serve him with
              a divine service, as only Yahweh deserves. The son of man in Daniel 7 is
              a divine Son of Man. Throughout the gospel of Mark, starting at 2:10,
              Jesus calls himself “the Son of Man,” though he never explicitly defines
              what he means by the term. In Mark 14:62, the climax of the gospel,
              Jesus finally reveals to everyone who he is by quoting Daniel 7:13–14:
              He is the Son of Man from Daniel 7. He is Yahweh.15
                  But claiming the title “Son of Man” was not the only blasphemous
              act he commits before the Sanhedrin. As if to remove all doubt, Jesus
              also says he has the right to sit on the throne of God. When he says that
              they will see the Son of Man “sitting at the right hand of the power”
              (NIV), he references Psalm 110:1, which says, “The Lord says to my
              lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for
              your feet’ ” (NIV).
                  Sitting at the right hand of God was a right that no one had dared
              claim, nor dared impute to anyone else, up to this point in Second




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 219                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

           220    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

           Temple Jewish history.16 It implied sitting on the very throne of God,
           and it was tantamount to claiming to be God’s heir, someone who shared
           sovereignty with God. According to a scholar of the Psalms, “ ‘Sitting at
           the right hand of God,’ . . . has a very definite meaning: ‘the king is
           installed into an associate rulership; in this position of honor in the
           power structure of God he becomes a participant in Yahweh’s strength
           in battle and victory.’ ”17
               After learning all this, I understood why the Sanhedrin wanted to
           crucify Jesus for blasphemy. When Jesus claimed to be the Son of Man
           from Daniel 7 and the Lord of David from Psalm 110, “Both claims
           imply divine status, authority and power.”18 In response to the ques-
           tion “Who are you?” Jesus’ response is essentially, “I am the One who
           deserves eternal worship from all mankind in My own kingdom, where
           I will sit on the very throne of God. I am Yahweh.”
               After reading Mark through the lens of Jewish scripture I could no
           longer avoid the obvious. From introduction to climax, Mark’s gospel
           is an exposition of the deity of Jesus. The first biography of Jesus ever
           written is designed to teach that Jesus is Yahweh.


           WAS JESUS GOD BEFORE THE GOSPELS?
           Although I was shocked to find Jesus’ deity in even the earliest of the
           Gospels, that was only because I was searching for the doctrine as a
           Muslim, and Muslims tend to focus on the Gospels. Had I paid more
           attention to the chronology of the New Testament, I would not have
           been surprised. The great majority of scholars believe that Christians
           had been teaching the deity of Jesus well before Mark’s gospel in the very
           earliest Christian writings we have: the letters of Paul.19 In 1 Corinthians
           8:6, Paul splits the Jewish shema into two. The Jewish proclamation of
           one God is cast as two persons, God the Father and the Lord Jesus. Also,
           in Romans 9:5, Paul says Jesus is “God over all, blessed into eternity.”
               But the most interesting is certainly Philippians 2:

                    Have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature
                 God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 220                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                     The Positive Case     221

                  own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very
                  nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found
                  in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient
                  to death—­even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the
                  highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that
                  at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth
                  and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is
                  Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
                                                  —­verses 5–11 NIV (emphases mine)

                  This passage is called the Carmen Christi, the “Song of Christ,” and
              its Christology is among the highest there can be. The beginning of
              the passage assumes Jesus’ preexistence in the very form of God, his
              ability to make decisions and act before his incarnation, and even his
              own hand in being born on earth. Thus the beginning of the Carmen
              Christi makes it clear that Jesus is God incarnate.
                  It then describes the future, when every knee will bow and every
              tongue will confess Jesus’ lordship. The kind of lordship Jesus has is the
              very lordship of Yahweh, because these are the words Yahweh uses of
              himself in one of the most powerfully monotheistic passages of the Old
              Testament: “I am God, and there is no other . . . to me every knee will
              bow, every tongue will swear” (Isa. 45:22–23). Once again, we find the
              earliest New Testament passages substituting Jesus for Yahweh.
                  But how early is this passage, and is Paul really the author? The
              scholarly consensus is that this passage is not one that Paul himself
              wrote but one that he is quoting. Beginning chiefly with the 1928 work
              of Ernst Lohmeyer, scholars have argued that this is a hymn that uses
              un-­Pauline vocabulary and grammatical structure.20 The vocabulary is
              so strange at points in this hymn that it is often not found anywhere
              else in the New Testament; one word is not even found elsewhere in the
              Greek language.21 Lohmeyer concluded that the hymn was written in
              Greek by a man other than Paul whose mother tongue was Semitic.22
              Others have since agreed, and some have even pushed the envelope,
              arguing that the hymn was originally written in Aramaic and was only
              later translated into Greek.23 These reasons and others combine to lead




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 221                                                    7/1/16 1:57 PM

           222    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

           scholars to conclude that the hymn was composed at the end of the
           thirties AD.24 So not just Paul, but also the pre–­New Testament church,
           perhaps as early as the Aramaic-­speaking church, ascribed to Jesus the
           very identity of Yahweh.


           CONCLUSION OF THE POSITIVE CASE FOR THE DEITY OF JESUS
           When I finished investigating the deity of Jesus, I realized that every
           layer of Christian teaching depicts Jesus as divine. It is impossible to
           argue that Jesus’ deity was a late invention, an evolution of Christology.
           Not only does John’s gospel present Jesus as divine, but even Mark’s
           gospel and Paul’s writings present Jesus as Yahweh. The very earliest
           evidence there is, possibly from the very decade of Jesus’ crucifixion,
           equates Jesus to Yahweh.
               For the earliest Christians, Jesus is more than a prophet, more than
           the Messiah, and more than divine. He is Yahweh himself.

                          THE ISLAMIC RESPONSE
                           DID JESUS REALLY SAY “I AM GOD”?




              W        hen I learned to read the New Testament in light of the Old, I
                       was able to see the deity of Jesus clearly in its pages, but it took
              me years as a Muslim to get to that point. Even though the Quran
              affirms that both the Torah and Injil were inspired, Muslims are not
              encouraged to know either of them in any detail, so instead of reading
              the Bible on its own terms we read it through the lens of the Quran and
              Islamic teaching.
                  That is why I rejected the deity of Christ for as long as I did. Not
              only was I predisposed against it, highlighting verses that seemed to
              challenge the doctrine, but also I expected Jesus to say certain things
              and speak certain ways if he really claimed to be God. Those two chal-
              lenges were my main arguments against Christians: There are many
              verses in the Bible that seem to deny Jesus’ deity, and Jesus never clearly
              says “I am God.” Together, these were my most compelling reasons to
              doubt that Jesus claimed to be God, and these are the same arguments
              that I find most Muslims using today.


              VERSES THAT DENY THE DEITY OF JESUS
              Thanks to the work of Ahmed Deedat and other Muslim apologists,
              there are many verses isolated from the Gospels readily used by Muslims
              to argue that Jesus explicitly denied divine status.
                  One of my favorites was John 17:3 because it seemed very Islamic
              in its proclamation: “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the

                                                                                       223




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 223                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           224    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

           only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (NIV). Just like
           the shahada, this verse proclaims the existence of only one God and a
           messenger whom he sent. Clearly, the one sent is inferior and separate
           from the one sending. As far as I was concerned, this verse showed that
           Jesus’ teachings were very similar to Islam’s, and that he denied being
           God, saying that the Father is the “only true God.”
               Another verse I commonly used on account of its stark clarity was
           John 14:28: “The Father is greater than I” (NIV). How could Jesus be
           God if the Father is greater than he is? This shows that Jesus is both
           separate from God and inferior to him. Another verse with a similar
           impact was Mark 10:18: “Why do you call me good? . . . No one is
           good—­except God alone” (NIV). Jesus again distinguishes himself
           from God and clarifies that he is inferior.
               Just as we would expect as Muslims, there are texts in the Gospels
           that show Jesus praying to God (Mark 1:35) and saying that people
           should worship God alone (Matt. 4:10). Mark 14:36 appears to show
           Jesus praying in desperation to the Father, saying, “Everything is possible
           for you. Take this cup from me” (NIV). Not only is Jesus praying to
           God, but he seems to be emphasizing that everything is possible for the
           Father, not for Jesus, and that Jesus is utterly dependent on him.
               Regarding this dependence, Jesus says that he can do nothing apart
           from God: “The Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he
           sees his Father doing” (John 5:19 NIV). His inability to do anything by
           himself was apparent again in Mark 6:5, when he returned to Nazareth
           and “could not do any miracles there” (NIV). Indeed, Jesus could not
           even prophesy without God’s intervention, as he said, “But about that
           day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,
           but only the Father” (Mark 13:32 NIV).
               We very frequently argued that Jesus was portrayed as a human and
           that the term “Son of God” did not imply a divine status. Adam had
           been called a “son of God” (Luke 3:38), as had David (Ps. 2:7), Solomon
           (1 Chron. 28:6), and even unnamed strangers (Gen. 6:2). In fact, the
           Bible taught that even we could become children of God (Rom. 8:14,
           Gal. 3:26). Therefore, Jesus was a “son of God” in the same sense, a
           human sense.

                  Finally, Jesus must have been just a human because he ate (John 21:12),
              wept (John 11:35), slept (Mark 4:38), hungered (Matt. 4:2), thirsted
              (John 4:7), and even tired (John 4:6). Could God really hunger, thirst,
              and grow tired? Of course God cannot, and therefore Jesus is not God.
              Also, he called himself a prophet (Luke 4:24), not God. The matter is
              settled when we consider his preferred term for himself: “Son of Man.”
              By using this title, Jesus emphasized that he was just a human, not God.


              JESUS NEVER CLEARLY SAYS “I AM GOD”
              In addition to pointing out the verses that seemed to deny Jesus’ deity
              and establish his humanity, I often challenged Christians by pointing
              out that he never actually says, “I am God.” If Jesus were God, why
              does he not just come out with it and say it? God certainly proclaims
              his divinity boldly in the Old Testament, with verses such as “I am the
              Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God” (Isa. 45:5
              NIV). Christians argue that Jesus is that very God, the one making the
              bold proclamation in Isaiah 45. Why does Jesus talk so differently about
              himself, never clearly saying he is God?
                  In fact, there seems to be a specific occasion when some Jews inter-
              preted Jesus as saying he is God, but Jesus clears up this misinterpretation
              (John 10:33–36). The Jews said, “You, a mere man, claim to be God,”
              to which Jesus responded, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you
              are “gods” ’ . . . Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said,
              ‘I am God’s Son’?” (NIV). When people think Jesus is claiming to be
              God, he tries to clarify the situation, explaining that many people were
              called “gods” in the Old Testament and therefore there is nothing wrong
              when Jesus calls himself “God’s Son.”
                  If he really were God, why did he not just say in that instance, “Yes,
              I am claiming to be God?” Why does he never say anything of that sort?
              Clearly, he was not claiming to be God.

           226    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?


           THE CLAIM TO DEITY AND THE HISTORICAL JESUS
           Those were the initial arguments I provided against the deity of Jesus,
           the ones that had been taught to me by the Muslim community, and
           I was confident that they were powerful. Later, as I progressed in my
           understanding of the responses to these arguments, I provided another
           challenge which was more nuanced and sophisticated: Even if it can be
           shown in the Gospels that Jesus does claim to be God, what reason do
           we have to think that this goes back to the actual Jesus?
               In other words, even if John depicts a divine Jesus, can we really
           think that Jesus claimed to be God himself? The same goes for the
           earlier writings of the New Testament, such as Mark and Paul. Even if
           they were to show that Jesus claimed to be God, maybe they invented it?
               Given the evidence at hand, and given the very notion itself, it is
           simply preposterous to believe that Jesus claimed to be God.


           CONCLUSION OF THE MUSLIM RESPONSE
           As Muslims, this was an arena in which we felt very confident: Jesus
           never claimed to be God. Never did he claim it, and there are many
           verses where he denies it, teaching that there is only one God. There is
           no God but one, and Jesus is just his messenger.

                                ISLAMIC RESPONSE
                               LETTING THE CONTEXT SPEAK




              T    aken in isolation, some of the verses presented would pose a chal-
                   lenge to the belief in Jesus’ deity, but that is the problem: The verses
              are not supposed to be taken in isolation. Much more than in Quranic
              exegesis, verses in the Bible depend on their context for proper interpre-
              tation. Considering the context of the verses and taking a closer look
              at the doctrine of Jesus’ deity resolves most of the Muslim challenge.
              To address the entire response, we will also consider Mark’s Messianic
              Secret and the likelihood that Jesus’ claim to be God goes back to the
              person of Jesus himself.


              CONSIDERING CONTEXT
              While a Muslim, I used many verses from the gospel of John to challenge
              the deity of Jesus, such as “the Father is greater than I” and “the Son can
              do nothing of himself.” As I became more acquainted with the Gospel, I
              began to see a major problem: John introduced his gospel by announcing
              that Jesus is God, as we discussed in chapter 30, and he concluded his
              gospel with a climactic pronouncement from a disciple that Jesus is God
              (John 20:28). In between, there were many verses that exalt Jesus and
              give him the honor due to God alone. This is why even skeptical scholars
              like Bart Ehrman say that Jesus is portrayed as divine in John’s gospel.
                  How could I use verses from John’s gospel to deny the deity of Jesus when

                                                                                       227

           228    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

           that Gospel as a whole certainly proclaimed that Jesus was God? That
           would be disingenuous, extracting verses out of their context to suit my
           purposes rather than seeing what they actually say.
               It was this realization that led me to change the way I approached
           the Bible. Instead of searching for verses from the text that I could use
           to support my Islamic position, I started reading each verse carefully for
           the meaning it intended to convey. This meant understanding verses in
           light of one another and having to put the puzzle pieces together. How
           could John’s gospel call Jesus Lord and God (John 20:28) and say that
           the universe was created through him (John 1:3), while also saying that
           “the Father is greater” than Jesus (John 14:28 NIV) and that Jesus can
           do nothing apart from the Father (John 5:19)? A proper understanding
           of John’s gospel must account for all these verses, not just some.
               The way to account for them, the way that the Christians of Nicaea
           and Chalcedon accounted for them, is by understanding that Jesus is
           God, that the Father is God, that the two are not the same person, yet
           there is only one God. In other words, the only way to account for the
           teachings of John’s gospel is through a monotheistic model with multiple
           persons: a Trinitarian model.1 In this model, the Father is greater than
           Jesus and Jesus does not do anything apart from the will of the Father,
           but both the Father and Jesus are God.
               An appropriate question that Muslims often ask is, “How can Jesus
           be God if the Father is greater than he is?” The question is easy to answer
           with an illustration. When I consider myself compared to the president
           of the United States, I would not hesitate to say that the president is
           greater than I. He is in charge of the entire nation and is one of the most
           powerful men in the world, whereas I am just a normal citizen. So the
           president is greater than I, far greater; but we are both equally human.
           In his essence, the president is just a human being, as am I, and in that
           sense we are equal. So when I say, “The president is greater than I,” I am
           referring to his office, not his essence. In office, he is greater than I; in
           essence, we are equal. Similarly, when Jesus says, “The Father is greater
           than I,” that does not mean Jesus is not God. The Father has a different
           role, a higher office than Jesus, but that does not mean the Father is
           greater in essence. They are both equal in essence. They are both God.

              REVISITING THE DOCTRINE OF JESUS’ DEITY AND THE TRINITY
              A proper understanding of the doctrine of Jesus’ deity resolves many of
              the Islamic arguments, even the ones using the texts of Mark, Matthew,
              and Luke. That Jesus hungered and thirsted does not challenge Jesus’
              deity, because Christians believe in the hypostatic union that we dis-
              cussed in chapter 10—that Jesus has a divine nature and a human
              nature, which means he really was a human and he really did hunger
              and thirst. For the same reason, God really could be a prophet. Since
              God can come into the world according to the Judeo-­Christian teach-
              ings, he can take a human nature and be both God and man. There is
              nothing mutually exclusive about his humanity and his deity.
                  I remember when I encountered this argument for the first time as
              a Muslim, I resisted it. Surely, to be God is to be unlimited, whereas to
              be human is to be limited. How can someone be limited and unlimited
              at the same time? For example, God knows all things, and Jesus did not
              know all things (Mark 13:32). How can Jesus be God?
                  The Christian response, found in Philippians 2, is that God vol-
              untarily limited the expression of his deity when he became human.
              Yes, theoretically Jesus could have known all things while on this earth,
              but he chose not to because he “did not consider equality with God
              something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself
              nothing by taking the very nature of a servant” (Phil. 2:6–7 NIV). He
              limited himself voluntarily, becoming a real man, so that as a man he
              could atone for the sins of man.
                  For that reason, he was a real human. Jesus was born. He could grow
              in wisdom and in stature. He was dependent on the Father, and as such
              he could pray to the Father. This is not “God praying to himself,” as
              some allege, because the Son is not the Father. There are two persons
              here, two selves.
                  Although there are many verses that I used to challenge the deity of
              Jesus as a Muslim, these two clarifications resolve almost all of them: the
              context of the verses and understanding the doctrine of the hypostatic
              union.

           230    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?


           WHY DID JESUS NOT SAY “I AM GOD”?
           UNDERSTANDING THE MESSIANIC SECRET
           Muslims ask a good question when they ask why Jesus did not boldly
           and publicly proclaim his deity, but a good answer is readily available:
           He did not want to announce his identity right away. This is stated
           explicitly at the beginning of Mark’s gospel. When Jesus was casting out
           demons, “He would not let the demons speak because they knew who
           he was” (Mark 1:34 NIV). Mark makes it explicit: Jesus wanted to keep
           his identity a secret for a time.2
               There were a variety of reasons why. When people came to learn
           about Jesus, they crowded around him so much that he was no longer
           able to go into towns (Mark 1:45). Also, as the Pharisees and Herodians
           began to see what Jesus was doing and claiming, they began to plot how
           they might kill him (Mark 3:6), but Jesus did not want to be killed until
           it was the right time.3 When Jesus and the disciples discussed the issue,
           he explained to them why he wanted to keep his identity secret: because
           “the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders,
           the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed
           and after three days rise again” (8:31 NIV).4
               So Jesus did not want to publicly proclaim his identity. This is
           known among scholars as the “Messianic Secret.” When the days
           of his death and ascension were approaching, he headed straight for
           Jerusalem (Luke 9:51). That is when he was arrested and taken before
           the Sanhedrin to reveal his identity.
               As a Muslim, I did not concede this point until I realized something
           surprising. Both Muslims and Christians agree Jesus is the Messiah, but
           in the Gospels Jesus only publicly proclaimed that he is the Messiah one
           time.5 That one location is at his trial before the Sanhedrin, the very
           passage where Jesus claims to be God.
               To repeat, the one time in the Gospels that Jesus publicly claimed to
           be the Messiah was the same time he publicly claimed to be God. Since
           Muslims believe Jesus was the Messiah even though he publicly pro-
           claimed it only once, we cannot demand he proclaim his deity more
           often or more boldly. He was not in the business of proclaiming his




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 230                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

              identity over and over again. He chose to wait for the right moment.
                  Also, though Jesus did not often proclaim his identity publicly, the
              Gospels inform their readers of his identity through the narrative of the
              text. For example, Mark 1:1 identifies Jesus as the Son of God;6 Mark
              1:11 shows God himself declaring that Jesus is his Son; verse 3:11 shows
              a demon declaring Jesus is the Son of God. By showing spiritual beings
              declaring Jesus’ sonship, Mark is able to inform his readers that Jesus is
              no mere mortal, letting the readers in on the secret even before Jesus’
              public proclamation at the trial.
                  Mark uses other means to inform the perceptive reader that Jesus is
              beyond human, as discussed in the previous chapter. He uses contro-
              versies, such as his public remission of the paralyzed man’s sin (2:5); he
              uses claims of sovereignty, such as his sovereignty over one of the Ten
              Commandments (2:28); he shows Jesus performing miracles that only
              God should be able to, such as calming the seas (4:38–39) and walking
              on the water (6:48).
                  Throughout his gospel, Mark is preparing the reader for the moment
              that the Messianic Secret will be revealed, when Jesus will tell everyone
              who he really is, tying together all his words and deeds. This makes
              14:62, the climax and divine revelation, all the more powerful and
              important to understand. It is there that Jesus claims to be the divine
              Son of Man from Daniel 7 and the One sitting on the throne of God
              from Psalm 110:1.
                  These two claims, Jesus’ most powerful proclamations of deity in
              the Gospels, are also our anchor of confidence that Jesus actually did
              use these terms.


              ASSESSING HISTORICAL ACCURACY
              What is powerful about Jesus’ claims before the Sanhedrin, historically
              speaking, is that they pass the most stringent scholarly criteria for his-
              torical accuracy. The title “Son of Man” is used more than eighty times
              in the four gospels, almost always by Jesus himself, in multiple settings.7
              Scholars are confident that Jesus actually used this phrase for himself
              because there was no widespread expectation that the Messiah would




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 231                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

           232    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

           be the Son of Man. In addition, the Christians in the early church did
           not really refer to Jesus as the Son of Man. Why would all four gospels
           show Jesus calling himself the Son of Man when no one expected the
           Messiah to speak that way and when people did not really refer to him
           in those terms later? The most plausible reason is that he actually used
           the title himself. Thus it passes the most stringent criterion of historical
           investigation, the criterion of dissimilarity.8 That Jesus called himself
           the Son of Man is virtually certain.
               Similarly, there can be little doubt that Jesus was considered the Lord
           of David who sits on the throne of God at a very early point in Christian
           history. It is the most commonly quoted Old Testament passage in the
           New Testament, deeply ingrained in the Christian conscience well
           before the New Testament was written.9 The best explanation for this
           early Christian unanimity regarding Psalm 110:1 is that Jesus himself
           taught and proclaimed that he is the one sitting at the right hand of the
           Power, worthy to rule the universe with the Father.
               Thus we can be confident that Jesus’ boldest proclamation of his
           identity, the one time he publicly proclaimed that he was the Messiah
           and God, are words that Jesus himself actually proclaimed.


           CONCLUDING OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MUSLIM RESPONSE
           The fact is not just John’s gospel but all the Gospels teach that Jesus is
           God. Though there are some verses in the Gospels that might appear
           to challenge Jesus’ deity, understanding them in their context and
           understanding the Christian doctrine of Jesus’ deity resolves them.
           Even Ehrman, the skeptical scholar most favored among Muslims, has
           now changed his mind and says: “The idea that Jesus is God is not an
           invention of modern times, of course. As I will show in my discussion,
           it was the view of the very earliest Christians soon after Jesus’s death.”10
           The best explanation for this immediate belief that Jesus is God, as the
           evidence shows, is that Jesus himself claimed to be God.

                                            CONCLUSION
                                  JESUS CLAIMED TO BE GOD




              T     he very earliest Christian records are unanimous: Jesus is God.
                    All four gospels teach that Jesus is divine, and even before they
              were written, Christians had firmly established God’s incarnation as the
              core of their faith. This was not a teaching that evolved over time but
              one that was present at the inception of the church and has its roots in
              Jesus’ proclamation. It makes sense when we study Jesus’ life through
              the lens of first-­century Judaism, including the Old Testament records
              of Yahweh visiting man and the expectation that he would come again.
              The common Islamic response, that there are verses that contravene the
              teaching of Jesus’ deity, usually does not take into consideration the
              context of those verses and at other times misunderstands the Messianic
              Secret or the doctrine of the hypostatic union.
                  When I was studying the Gospels as a Muslim, I was shocked to dis-
              cover these facts. Having always believed that the doctrine of Jesus’ deity
              was invented decades if not centuries after Jesus’ death, I realized that the
              Islamic explanation for Christian beliefs does not work. The very first
              Christians believed that Jesus is God, including the disciples themselves.
              How could the disciples have concluded this, especially considering the
              Jewish emphasis on monotheism and on worshiping God alone?
                  The best conclusion is that Jesus himself claimed to be God. The
              Gospels are telling the truth. As a Muslim my mind rebelled against
              this, but considering the perspective of an objective investigator I had
              to admit that it was the best explanation of the evidence. Nothing else
              accounted for the origins of the church without strain.

                                                                                       233

               Putting together the components for the case for Christianity, there
           was little room for me as a Muslim to object. The historical evidence
           was so contrary to Islamic teaching that there was no ground for me to
           stand on.

                      ASSESSING THE CASE FOR
                     CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM’S
                     EFFORTS TO ACCOUNT FOR
                        CHRISTIAN ORIGINS


              A    fter studying the historical origins of the Christian faith, I came
                   to these conclusions: that Jesus died on the cross is as certain as
              anything historical can be; that he rose from the dead is by far the best
              explanation of the events surrounding his death; and that Jesus claimed
              to be God is the best explanation for the immediate Christian procla-
              mation of Jesus’ deity.
                  Putting it all together, the historical evidence for Christianity is very
              strong: Jesus claimed to be God, and he proved it by rising from the
              dead. The case for Christianity is powerful.
                  Despite my ardent desire to believe Islam, I had to admit that his-
              tory was in favor of Christian claims, and even more reluctantly, that it
              challenged Islamic teachings. In order to believe the Quran when it says
              Jesus did not claim to be God, we have to ignore the best explanation
              of early Christian beliefs; and to believe the Quran’s teachings about
              Jesus’ death, we would have to dismiss all the historical evidence. So the
              records of Christian origins testify against Islam.
                  But the evidence is actually even more problematic for Islam than
              it might initially appear. Far more problematic. Islamic teachings about
              Jesus are utterly incompatible with history.

           236    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?


           THE UTTER INCOMPATIBILITY OF ISLAM WITH JESUS’ IDENTITY
           For Islamic teaching to be true, it is not enough for Jesus to simply deny
           deity; Jesus has to proclaim that he is merely a human prophet. But the
           earliest records are categorically against Islam on this point.
               Even a cursory glance at the Gospels shows us that Jesus sees him-
           self as greater than a mere human. Of course, as we have already seen,
           Jesus considers himself able to forgive sins, receive worship, heal people
           in his own authority, demand the honor that is due to God, hear and
           answer prayers, ransom mankind by his death, and exist even before
           Abraham was born. But Jesus also commended people who called
           him God (John 20:28), claimed to be the king of another realm (John
           18:36–37), descended from heaven (John 3:13), and claims to be the
           judge on the day of judgment (John 5:22–23). Such teachings are not
           just found in John’s gospel; the Synoptic Gospels agree that Jesus is the
           king over an eternal kingdom (Matt. 25:34), that he is the one who
           will judge mankind (Matt. 25:32), that he has the authority to grant
           people salvation (Luke 23:43), that he has elected people who will go to
           heaven (Mark 13:27), and that his return to earth will be as the return
           of the master to his own house (Mark 13:35). Of course, this is all in the
           context of Jesus’ claim to be heir of God’s throne from Psalm 110, sitting
           on the throne of God, and as the divine Son of Man from Daniel 7 who
           is worshiped by all men in his eternal kingdom.
               These are the teachings of the Gospels, the earliest biographies
           of Jesus’ life, produced during the lifetimes of Jesus’ disciples. There
           is absolutely no early Christian record of a merely human Jesus. All
           evidence indicates that Jesus’ followers uniformly believed him to be
           divine, unquestionably more than a mere human.
               How can the Islamic model account for this? Why is it that the
           followers of Jesus preached a superhuman Jesus, in fact God himself?
           Without dismissing the history, there is no alternative explanation.
           Islam requires us to believe that Jesus was so incompetent as a teacher
           and prophet that he was not able to instill this most simple fact in his
           followers’ minds: that he was merely a human. Given that Islam’s central
           proclamation is tawhid, this means Jesus was an abject failure. In fact,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 236                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

              he was worse than a total failure, since he left his disciples believing the
              exact opposite of tawhid.
                  Could I really conclude that the Messiah was so woefully incompe-
              tent? Of course not, but that is what Islam requires us to believe if we are
              to take the historical evidence seriously. The records of Jesus’ identity
              are not just slightly mismatched with Islamic teachings; the records of
              Jesus’ identity are categorically incompatible with Islam. If Jesus truly
              taught tawhid, he was an entirely incompetent Messiah, worse than an
              abject failure.


              THE UTTER INCOMPATIBILITY OF ISLAM
              WITH EARLY CHRISTIAN PROCLAMATION
              Similarly, Islam teaches that the disciples were godly men, but the entire
              body of evidence testifies that the proclamation of the early church was
              the death and resurrection of Jesus—­something Islam denies. How
              could I account for this discrepancy as a Muslim?
                   The only option that accounted for the historical evidence was that
              the disciples simply got the facts wrong; but upon consideration, this
              posed a serious problem for my Islamic belief. If Allah saved Jesus from
              the cross while making it look like Jesus died, as most Muslims believe,
              then Allah is responsible for the disciples’ proclamation of Jesus’ death
              and resurrection. Therefore, Allah started Christianity, a false religion
              that has kept billions away from Islam. Worse, Christians believe Jesus
              is God because of their faith in his resurrection, yet the Quran tells us
              that people who believe Jesus is God will go to hell (5.72). Could I really
              believe that, just to save Jesus from the cross, God deceived the disciples,
              letting them proclaim that Jesus is the risen Lord and thereby sending
              billions of people to hell?
                   Again, there is absolutely no record of a disciple who preached any-
              thing other than the death and resurrection of Jesus. Why did Allah not
              adequately communicate to them that Jesus had not died on the cross
              and had not risen from the dead? Allah could easily have stopped them
              from preaching the death and resurrection of Jesus. But the history is
              incontrovertible: The foundation of the disciples’ preaching was the




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 237                                                             7/1/16 1:57 PM

           238    Did Jesus Claim to Be God?

           proclamation of Jesus’ resurrection. Therefore, if it is true that Allah
           saved Jesus from the cross, the deception of Allah is responsible for the
           establishment of the Christian church and billions of people commit-
           ting shirk, the unforgivable sin.
               Could I really conclude that Allah committed such a massive blun-
           der? Of course not, but that is what Islam requires us to believe if we
           are to take the historical evidence seriously. The records of the early
           Christian proclamation are not just slightly mismatched with Islamic
           teachings; the records of the early Christian proclamation are categorically
           incompatible with Islam. If Allah saved Jesus from the cross and did not
           inform the disciples, he is a deceptive God who is responsible for the
           damnation of billions.
               For these reasons, if we are Muslim and we take the historical evi-
           dence of Christian origins seriously, we have to conclude that Jesus was
           an incompetent Messiah and Allah is a deceptive God.


           ISLAM’S REJECTION OF HISTORY
           Of course, Muslims do not believe that, and neither did I. I took the only
           remaining alternative: Reject all of the historical evidence of Christian
           origins, regardless of how much there is, how widespread it is, and how
           firmly grounded it is. The historical records are incredibly vast, includ-
           ing dozens of sources from dozens of authors—­Christian, Jewish, and
           Graeco-­Roman alike. Could I really just dismiss everything, turning a
           blind eye to all the evidence, to maintain my Islamic beliefs?
               I also knew something I could no longer overlook: Scholars are
           virtually unanimous that Jesus died on the cross, that the early church
           believed he rose from the dead, and that the earliest Christians believed
           he was superhuman, even divine. Not just Christian scholars but even
           skeptical scholars are virtually all on the same side on these issues, against
           the teachings of Islam. As a Muslim, I had a great deal of respect for
           scholars, but now I knew their conclusions were against my faith. The
           people who spend their lives studying these matters disagree with Islam.
               While pondering all this, my mind continually returned to that
           question I forced myself to ask: “Would an objective investigator throw




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 238                                                   7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                      Assessing the Case for Christianity and Islam’s Efforts   239

              out all the evidence? Would an objective investigator side with Islam on
              these issues?” The answer was obvious: of course not. To believe Islam
              on the history of Christian origins is to dismiss all evidence ad hoc, and
              no objective investigator would do that.


              A TENTATIVE CONCLUSION
              After spending three years investigating the case for Christianity as a
              Muslim, I tentatively concluded that Christians had good historical
              reason to believe in their faith. This was a paradigm shift in my mind,
              utterly incompatible with what I had been taught as a Muslim, but it
              was unavoidably true.
                  And because the evidence also challenged my Islamic beliefs, I had
              to either ignore it all (which my mind could not do), become a Christian
              (which I could not even imagine), or believe that, despite how strong the
              evidence for Christianity was, the evidence for Islam must be stronger.
                  The last option was the only viable option for me, so I found myself
              assuming that the case for Islam must be stronger than the case for
              Christianity. But my friend David would not allow me to operate on
              such an assumption without providing evidence.
                  That is why I delved into our investigation of Islam: to prove that
              the case for Islam is stronger than the case for Christianity. My first
              step was to corral the evidence that Muhammad was a prophet of God.
              After spending some time preparing, David invited me to argue my case
              at a discussion group of people from many religious backgrounds that
              met monthly at Mike Licona’s house. It was there that I presented my
              positive case that Muhammad was a prophet of God.

                                THE POSITIVE CASE
                                    THE FORETOLD PARAGON




              I   bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.” This is
                  the proclamation of a devout Muslim, announced multiple times
              a day from every minaret before the daily prayers and recited in the
              heart of every Muslim during the prayers. The proclamation that “there
              is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger” is enough to
              welcome a person into the fold of Islam. There really can be no doubt
              that Muhammad’s status as a messenger of God, his prophethood, is a
              central pillar of Islamic faith.
                  Growing up Muslim, Muhammad’s prophethood was a given, an
              integral part of our world, and sharing Islam meant compelling hearts
              toward him. It is for that reason, when my friend David asked me to
              share Islam with a room full of non-­Muslims, I chose to present and
              defend the prophethood of Muhammad.
                  Seated in Mike Licona’s living room and speaking to Christians,
              Buddhists, atheists, and agnostics, I made my case for Muhammad’s
              prophethood. I presented three arguments: that Muhammad’s life and
              character testified that he was a prophet; that Muhammad was proph-
              esied in the Bible; and that Muhammad had God-­given insight into
              science.


              MUHAMMAD’S LIFE AND CHARACTER
              Providing a portrait of Muhammad’s life that had passed down to me
              through generations, I started by telling everyone that Muhammad lived

                                                                                243




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 243                                          7/1/16 1:57 PM

           244    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           a very meek and humble childhood. His father died before he was born,
           his mother died shortly thereafter, and he lived most of his childhood as
           an orphan. He grew to become a trusted and respected young merchant,
           ultimately marrying a widow fifteen years his elder instead of a youthful
           maiden. Muhammad was thus a very noble young man uninterested in
           worldly attractions even before receiving his prophetic call.
               It was only with reluctance that he accepted the mantle of prophet-
           hood. Within the pagan environment of Mecca, Muhammad boldly
           proclaimed monotheism with no concern for his personal well-­being.
           Understanding the plight of widows, orphans, and the poor, he fought
           for their rights.
               Despite his peaceful message, the hatred of the Meccans against
           the message of monotheism led to persecutions. Although Muhammad
           was protected by his uncle, he faced ridicule and threats, even having
           camel entrails placed on him while he was prostrate in prayer. His
           followers, who had no protectors, fared worse, some even being mar-
           tyred. The persecutions increased over the years, and the Meccans
           ultimately boycotted the Muslims, resulting in such harsh conditions
           that Muhammad’s uncle and wife died. When a plot was underway to
           assassinate Muhammad, he fled to Medina, and it was there that he
           finally had enough support to defend the fledgling Muslim people.
               From that point on, Muhammad invited the tribes of Arabia to
           accept Islam, and many became allies of the Muslims on account of
           the beauty of the message. All the while, the Meccans kept coming to
           Medina to destroy the Muslims, but Allah miraculously defended them.
           After ten years of having to fight such defensive wars, Muhammad
           made a treaty with the Meccans that allowed him to travel to Mecca and
           perform a pilgrimage to the sacred mosque, the Kaaba. Unfortunately,
           the Meccans broke their treaty, so Muhammad marched on Mecca with
           ten thousand followers. The Meccans could not withstand the might of
           the Muslim armies, so they surrendered.
               Although these were the very people who had persecuted and killed
           Muslims—­the ones who caused the death of Muhammad’s beloved
           uncle and first wife, and the very ones who dragged the Muslims into
           war time and again at the cost of many lives—­Muhammad granted

                                                                  The Positive Case   245

              them clemency by forgiving all of them. The fame of Muhammad’s
              message spread throughout Arabia, and by the time Muhammad died
              two years later, the whole Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam.
                  Such was the character of Muhammad: In addition to being a
              champion for women and orphans, he was a resilient proclaimer of mon-
              otheism, a great leader, and a merciful conqueror. His life and character
              are proof that he is a prophet of God.


              MUHAMMAD IN THE BIBLE
              An even more common argument among Muslims than the compelling
              character of Muhammad is the case that Muhammad is prophesied in
              the Bible.
                  The Quran teaches that Muhammad was prophesied in the Torah
              and the gospel: “The messenger, the unlettered prophet whom they will
              find with them written in the Torah and the Gospel” (7.157).1 For this
              reason, Muslims are willing to use Bible verses to defend the prophet-
              hood of Muhammad. There were two such biblical passages that we
              used more than any other, usually quoting the King James Version:
              Deuteronomy 18:18–19 and John 16:12–14.

              Deuteronomy 18
                  In Deuteronomy 18:18–19, God says, “I will raise them up a Prophet
              from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in
              his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
              And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my
              words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him” (KJV).
              In this passage, God is addressing Moses, saying a prophet like Moses
              will come, one who will come from among the brethren of the Jews and
              speak in the name of God.
                  Muslims commonly argue that, even though Christians believe this
              passage refers to Jesus, it speaks of Muhammad. Who is more “like
              unto” Moses: Jesus or Muhammad? Moses was born naturally, came
              with a law, led his people for many years, was a statesman as well as
              a prophet, had to lead his people out of oppression, married and had

           246    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           children, and ultimately died a natural death; none of this is true of
           Jesus, yet all of it is true of Muhammad. Undoubtedly, Moses is more
           like Muhammad than Jesus.
               In addition, the prophecy says that the prophet will be “from among
           their brethren,” that is, the brethren of the Jews. The Jews are Israelites,
           and their brethren are the Ishmaelites. Therefore, the prophecy speaks
           of a prophet like Moses from the lineage of Ishmael. That must be
           Muhammad.
               Finally, the passage says that the prophet will reveal “words which he
           shall speak in my name.” In the Quran, every chapter begins with, “In
           the name of Allah.” Thus, more than anyone else, Muhammad spoke in
           the name of God, and every chapter of the Quran testifies to this.
               Thus I presented the common argument that, through Moses in the
           Old Testament, God prophesied the coming of Muhammad.

           John 16
               In John’s gospel, the sixteenth chapter also speaks of a prophet who
           will come, I argued. The text reads, “I have yet many things to say
           unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit
           of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he shall not speak
           of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will
           shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of
           mine, and shall shew it unto you” (vv. 12–14 KJV).
               Here, Jesus speaks of a prophet, the Spirit of truth (v. 13), who will
           come and finish Jesus’ message. Who else could this be but Muhammad,
           the only prophet of a major religion to come after Jesus? As in the
           Deuteronomy prophecy, this text describes one who will not speak of
           himself, but only what he hears. The Quran is revelation that was given
           to Muhammad, not composed by him whatsoever, so he spoke only
           what he heard, just as the prophecy says.
               In addition, John 16 says the Spirit of truth will glorify Jesus.
           Unlike the Jews who said Jesus was an illegitimate child, Muhammad
           proclaimed that Jesus truly was born of a virgin, thereby glorifying him
           when others were not and fulfilling the prophecy.
               To top off the argument, the Greek of John 16:7 uses the word




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 246                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                   The Positive Case   247

              parakletos to describe this “Spirit of truth.” This word is very similar to
              the Greek word periklutos, which means “the praised one.” In Arabic,
              the word Muhammad means “the praised one.” Thus, Jesus used the
              Greek word for Muhammad when prophesying the coming Spirit of
              truth.
                  For all these reasons, we could be confident that, through Jesus, God
              prophesied the coming of Muhammad in the New Testament. These
              were just two prophecies I chose to present that night out of over a dozen
              such prophesies that Muslims commonly argue establish Muhammad’s
              authority and prophethood.


              MIRACULOUS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
              The final argument I presented to the attendees of our meeting was
              Muhammad’s miraculous scientific knowledge. This argument was
              usually provided in defense of the Quran, but I and many other Muslims
              presented it to defend the prophethood of Muhammad as well. While
              delivering the Quran and while answering questions recorded in hadith,
              Muhammad showed insight into science that he could not have possibly
              known as a man living in the seventh century. This could mean only
              that God was giving Muhammad supernatural wisdom, and therefore
              that he was a prophet of God.
                  For example, in 23.12–14, the Quran describes the development of
              an embryo in stages. Describing zygotic development from fertilization
              to differentiation, the Quran shows familiarity with a scientific field
              that was unknown in Muhammad’s day. It was not until the develop-
              ment of modern medicine that we find mankind discovering what was
              already revealed in the Quran.
                  Another common argument we used was that the Quran relayed
              miraculous geological truth about mountains. In 78.6–7, the Quran
              describes mountains as “pegs,” indicating that they have roots which
              go beneath the surface of the earth. Only in modern times has science
              uncovered the existence of such roots. In addition, the Quran teaches
              that these mountain roots stabilize the earth, which the science of plate
              tectonics has only recently established.

           248    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

                Since Muhammad was the one who received these miraculous scien-
           tific teachings, he must be a prophet of God.


           CONCLUDING THE POSITIVE CASE
           FOR MUHAMMAD’S PROPHETHOOD
           After presenting my argument to the discussion group for forty-­five
           minutes, I felt confident that I had argued the case for Muhammad’s
           prophethood strongly. His life and message are inherent proof that he is
           a prophet of God; his coming was prophesied by the messengers before
           him like Moses and Jesus; and the advanced scientific knowledge that
           was revealed through him proves that he is a prophet of God. Together,
           these are compelling reasons to believe that Muhammad is a prophet
           and that Islam is the truth sent by God.
               But then came the questions, issues I had not seen that challenged
           the prophethood of Muhammad.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 248                                             7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                            Chapter 34



                                      THE RESPONSE
                        DON’T FORGET THE COUNTEREVIDENCE




              W        hen I finished my presentation on the historical Muhammad,
                       the very first question was from Mike. Since he had studied
              Islam for his debate with Shabir Ally, he knew that there were holes in
              my presentation, evidence I had not provided before concluding that
              Muhammad’s character is peaceful. “Nabeel,” he asked, “there are other
              verses in the Quran, like, ‘Slay the infidel wherever you find him.’ How
              do we know that what you quoted takes precedence?”
                  Although I was very often offended when people questioned
              Muhammad’s character, it was fair to ask. If I am presenting
              Muhammad’s excellent character as evidence that he is a prophet of
              God, that means I have to allow counterevidence that might lead us
              to conclude Muhammad’s character was not that of a prophet of God.
              The same holds true for the prophecies pertaining to Muhammad and
              Muhammad’s scientific knowledge; we must weigh potential counterex-
              amples. When we consider the full body of evidence, is the prophethood
              of Muhammad still the best conclusion?


              CRITICALLY CONSIDERING MUHAMMAD’S CHARACTER
              When we read about the life of Muhammad, there is no doubt that
              Muhammad taught many good things. This goes beyond the simple
              proclamation of monotheism and submission to God. Muhammad
              taught people to feed the poor;1 to love others for God’s sake;2 to abstain
              from theft, fornication, and infanticide;3 to release slaves, help the weak,

                                                                                      249




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 249                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           250    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           and serve those who cannot work for themselves;4 and much more.
           When considering the historical record of Muhammad’s life, one has
           to conclude that he taught many things that were very moral and noble.
                But before concluding that he is a prophet of God, one has to
           consider the counterevidence, and we will consider only that evidence
           which is found in the sources most Muslims consider most trustworthy:
           the Quran and the hadith of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim.
                The best place to start is at the beginning. When he received his
           very first revelation, Muhammad reacted very strangely: He became sui-
           cidal. “He intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high
           mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to
           throw himself down,” an angel would appear to him and urge him not
           to kill himself.5 Is this the behavior of a prophet? No prophet in the Old
           Testament or New Testament ever became suicidal after seeing an angel.
                Muhammad’s initial encounter with a spiritual being sounds little
           like an angelic encounter at all. According to the same hadith, this spiri-
           tual being was called Namus.6 Namus grabbed hold of Muhammad and
           squeezed him so vehemently that he could not bear it.7 Three times Namus
           squeezed Muhammad unbearably hard until Muhammad ultimately
           complied with his command. To the objective observer, this sounds like
           a violent episode, not at all like an angelic encounter. The beginning of
           Muhammad’s ministerial career sounds little like that of a prophet.
                When we consider whether he was a man of peace, we must recog-
           nize that though Muhammad’s ministry was fraught with battles, that
           in itself is not evidence against his divine commission. Joshua and others
           in the Old Testament had been commanded to fight.
                What is striking, though, is how enthusiastically Muhammad
           embraced warfare. He said that fighting is literally the best thing in the
           world.8 Nothing earns a Muslim more reward than fighting in jihad,
           and it is better than praying without ceasing and fasting perpetually.9
           Muhammad taught that dying in battle is so great that it is the only
           thing that would make a man want to leave heaven.10
                As far as his conduct with enemies, at times Muhammad would
           invoke curses upon them11 and encourage his men to compose insults
           and abusive poetry.12 On one occasion, he asked Allah to fill peoples’




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 250                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                       The Response   251

              homes with flames simply because they delayed the Muslims in their
              daily prayers.13 At other times, Muhammad sent assassins to kill his
              enemies in their sleep,14 and even to deceive and abuse trust in order to
              assassinate.15 He punished some enemies by cutting off their hands and
              feet, branding their eyes with a heated iron, and causing them to lick
              the dust until they died.16 He led battles against unarmed cities.17 He
              allowed even women and children to be killed during nighttime raids.18
              On more than one occasion, Muhammad decimated tribes by killing
              all their men and teenage boys while distributing their women and
              children as slaves.19 This is quite contrary to the image of a Muhammad
              who reluctantly fought only defensive battles.
                  It also does not appear that Muhammad fought only those who were
              attacking him. Muhammad said, “I have been ordered to fight against
              the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshiped but
              Allah and that Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger . . . then they save their
              lives and property from me.”20 Muhammad clarifies in another hadith,
              “I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and
              will not leave any but Muslim.”21
                  There can be no denying, based on these records, that Muhammad
              fought people and wished to expel them from Arabia based on their
              beliefs. Only if they became Muslim would they “save their lives and
              property from” Muhammad. How could we argue that Muhammad
              was so peaceful that it proved his prophetic status?
                  In assessing Muhammad’s character, we have considered only two
              matters in any depth: the beginning of his ministry and his teachings
              regarding warfare. These alone are enough to question Muhammad’s
              character and prophethood, but in case more is needed, there is much,
              much more that skeptics commonly bring to the table, such as concerns
              about his spiritual aptitude, his teachings about women, his troubling
              theological teachings, his incorrect understandings of Judaism and
              Christianity, his unfulfilled prophecies, his commands to perform idol-
              atrous rites, and his special allowances for himself. We will briefly touch
              on just the first two.22
                  As far as his spiritual aptitude and authority, apart from considering
              suicide on several occasions, Muhammad said that he had been a victim




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 251                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

           252    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           of black magic;23 he had delusional thoughts of doing things he had not
           done;24 and he confused demonic inspiration with divine inspiration,
           saying Satan had put Quran verses into his heart which he then used
           in prayer.25
               Regarding his estimation and treatment of women: Muhammad
           allowed for prostitution through the institution of temporary marriage;26
           when fifty-­t wo years old he consummated his marriage with his nine-­
           year-­old bride Aisha, who was still playing with dolls;27 Muhammad
           allowed his men to have sex with female captives and slaves, unconcerned
           if they became pregnant or were to be sold;28 Muhammad declared
           women to be mentally deficient compared to men;29 and Muhammad
           said women will be the majority of hell’s inhabitants because they are
           ungrateful to their husbands.30
               The issues we have covered should suffice for our present point.
           Though Muhammad may have taught many good things and been a
           man of mercy at times, given the extensive counterevidence, we cannot
           conclude that his character is excellent enough to prove he is a prophet
           of God.


           LOOKING MORE CAREFULLY FOR MUHAMMAD IN THE BIBLE
           Though there are many suggested prophecies of Muhammad in the
           Bible, the ones from Deuteronomy 18 and John 16 are the ones we con-
           sidered strongest and therefore the ones we most frequently advanced.
           A common problem with the way we handled them, though, was that
           we tried to make the text conform to our expectation. Instead of under-
           standing what the words meant and what they intended to convey, we
           did our best to read them as prophecies about Muhammad.
               For example, while reading Deuteronomy 18, we never bothered to
           consider the Old Testament notion of a prophet, always just assuming
           the Islamic notion. In the Old Testament, a prophet is anyone who
           prophesies because the spirit of Yahweh rests upon him (or her!). The
           Old Testament speaks of prophetesses (Judg. 4:4) and whole groups of
           prophets at once (1 Sam. 10:5), and neither of these cases aligns with the
           Muslim notion of prophethood.




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 252                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                       The Response   253

                   Where our interpretation of words became a real problem in
              Deuteronomy 18, though, was the way we interpreted “from among
              their brethren.” This phrase cannot mean from among the Ishmaelites.
              Whenever the Bible uses this phrase it means “countrymen,” always
              referring to either close kinsmen or clansmen. It never means anything
              as distant as an entirely different people group related only through a
              distant ancestor.
                   One does not need to be all that familiar with the biblical use of the
              term to conclude this because the previous chapter defines the term for
              us. In Deuteronomy 17:15, the Bible says, “You shall set over yourselves
              a king whom Yahweh your God chooses, from among your brethren.
              You shall not set a foreigner over yourselves, who is not your brother.” So
              the text defines the word for us: A brother from among the Hebrews is a
              Hebrew. He cannot be a foreigner, and the Ishmaelites were foreigners.
              This text cannot be about Muhammad.
                   Similarly, in John 16, we used to do whatever we could to read
              Muhammad into the text, ignoring the counterevidence that simply did
              not allow it. The Greek word was parakletos and not periklutos, no matter
              how much we wanted Jesus to use the Greek equivalent to Muhammad.
              And just as brethren had been defined in the paragraphs preceding the
              Deuteronomy passage, parakletos had been defined earlier in the same
              passage of John. In 14:26, the text tells us the parakletos is the Holy
              Spirit. There is no room for conjecture; the prophecy was about the
              Holy Spirit living inside Christians. It was not about the coming of any
              man, let alone a prophet.
                   This is why the text says about the Spirit of truth, “The world cannot
              accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know
              him, for he lives with you and will be in you” (John 14:17 NIV). The
              disciples already knew the Spirit of truth because the Holy Spirit was
              with them and would soon be in them. How could this be Muhammad?
              Muhammad was not already with them, nor could he possibly be in
              them. In context, it is impossible to conclude that the Spirit of truth
              from John 14–16 is Muhammad.
                   The same turns out to be the case when we consider any of the
              so-­called “Muhammad in the Bible” prophecies. In most of them, the

           254    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           Bible is not prophesying the coming of anyone at all. In others, the
           full context brings in counterevidence that prohibits us from concluding
           that it is about Muhammad. There simply is no compelling prophecy
           about Muhammad in the Bible.


           MUHAMMAD AND SCIENCE
           Counterevidence and context have proven problematic for arguments
           proposing Muhammad’s prophethood, and the same is the case when
           we examine the argument from miraculous scientific knowledge, that
           Muhammad knew science so advanced it must have come from God.
               Consider the example of Quranic embryology. Before even looking
           at the text of the Quran, we should consider what mankind had already
           discovered in order to properly calibrate what might be miraculous
           knowledge. About a thousand years before Muhammad, Aristotle had
           published a treatise on embryology, On the Generation of Animals. It
           is far more scientific and detailed than anything Muhammad sug-
           gests, being a whole book on the topic of embryology. In section 734a,
           Aristotle explicitly discusses embryological development in stages.31 In
           section 745b, he mentions that an embryo is attached to the uterus via
           an umbilicus.32 Galen, a Greek scientist living about five hundred years
           after Aristotle and five hundred years before Muhammad, also wrote
           a treatment on embryology, On the Natural Faculties. Agreeing that
           development happens in stages, he says, “Now Nature constructs bone,
           cartilage, nerve, membrane, ligament, vein, and so forth, at the first
           stage of the animal’s genesis, employing at this task a faculty which is,
           in general terms, generative and alterative.”33 Both Aristotle and Galen
           had very carefully defined terms and concepts, positing in great detail
           the process of embryological development.
               Turning now to the Quran, let us quote the passage in question,
           23.12–14: “And indeed we made man from an essence of clay; then we
           placed him as a drop in a safe lodging; Then we made the drop a hanging
           (thing), then we made the hanging into a chewed (thing), then we made
           the chewed into bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh, then we
           developed it into another creation, so blessed be Allah, the best of creators.”

                                                                       The Response   255

                   At the outset, we must conclude that there is no possibility of any-
              thing miraculous here. In no way can it be argued that Muhammad
              would not have known details of embryology when whole books had
              been written by Aristotle a thousand years prior and Galen five hundred
              years prior. In addition, the Quran uses poorly delineated terms and
              concepts, nowhere near the scientific precision of Galen. Many Muslim
              explanations of this passage assume “hanging” and “chewed” have spe-
              cific embryological referents; and they may assume this if they already
              believe the Quran has miraculous scientific knowledge, but they cannot
              assume this in order to prove it has such knowledge. Such a deduction
              would be circular. The unrefined language makes this passage undeci-
              pherable, not miraculous.
                   What can be ascertained through the rudimentary wording is the
              notion of development in stages, but this is certainly not miraculous as it
              was well-­k nown by Muhammad’s time. Similarly, Aristotle had already
              described the tethering of an embryo to the uterus via an umbilical cord
              (i.e., a hanging thing). Regarding a chewed thing, women in Arabia
              suffered miscarriages as do women today, and they would have seen
              fetuses such as the Quran describes.
                   Regarding details, we can only guess as to what was meant by that
              section of the passage. As far as understanding the text with clarity,
              the only section of this Quranic passage that makes a plain assertion is
              that bones are developed first and that they are then clothed with flesh.
              Unfortunately, this is false. Modern science has taught us that a single
              embryological layer, the mesoderm, differentiates into bones and flesh
              at the same time.
                   Thus, the one section of this passage that is stated clearly is scien-
              tifically inaccurate, and the whole passage is far less sophisticated than
              texts that had been written a thousand years prior. This is simply not a
              miraculous passage whatsoever.
                   Regarding the allegedly miraculous insight about mountains, that
              they stabilize the earth and have roots, much can be said, but it would
              be helpful just to point out the patterns. Here again, the scientific
              assertion is false. Mountains do not create stability in the earth’s crust;
              instead, they are a result of tectonic instability. Although the assertion




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 255                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

           256    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           that mountains have roots beneath the earth’s surface is correct in a
           sense, the Quran was certainly not the first book to posit this. We see
           that assertion made at least three times in the Bible: Job 28:9, Psalm
           18:7, and Jonah 2:6.
               As a Muslim, I believed there were dozens of examples of miracu-
           lous scientific knowledge in the Quran, but when I started investigating
           them carefully, I found that each and every one succumbed to at least
           one of three critiques: First, the verses were being made to say things
           they did not assert (much like the “Muhammad in the Bible” prophe-
           cies); second, the science was actually well-­k nown before Muhammad’s
           day (such as embryological development in stages); or third, the science
           was false (such as the bones developing before muscles).
               There are many examples of the third criticism, which really is the
           nail in the coffin for this argument. These incorrect statements are
           found in both the Quran and hadith. For example, just in the field of
           embryology, the Quran is incorrect regarding spermatogenesis, asserting
           that semen is produced between a man’s backbone and his ribs (86.7). In
           the hadith, we find a case that is very telling: A man asked Muhammad
           to prove that he is a prophet by correctly answering questions.34 One
           of the questions inquired why a child might look like his father more
           than his mother, or vice versa. Muhammad responded that Gabriel had
           informed him of the answer to his question: The first parent to have
           discharge during intercourse determined the appearance of the child.
               It goes without saying that this is scientifically false, because genet-
           ics determine the appearance of a child. We ought not blame a man
           in the seventh century for being unfamiliar with Mendelian genetics,
           but in this case, Muhammad actually was trying to prove that he was a
           prophet of God through his scientific insights, and he was very wrong.
           That stark reality was enough to give me pause as a Muslim.
               There were many more times when Muhammad was incorrect in his
           science, and examples can be found in the Quran as well as the hadith.
           For example, apart from what we have already seen, the Quran says
           that the sun sets in a pool of muddy water in the west (18.86),35 and
           it assumes stars are the same thing as meteorites (67.5). In the hadith,
           apart from what we have already seen, Muhammad teaches that flies




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 256                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                     The Response   257

              carry diseases on one wing and antidotes on the other,36 that cumin
              heals all diseases,37 and that camel urine cures stomach aches.38 These
              are but a few examples of many of Muhammad’s scientific inaccuracies.


              CONCLUDING THE RESPONSE TO THE CASE
              FOR MUHAMMAD’S PROPHETHOOD
              It is worth remembering that we have not tried to disprove Muhammad’s
              prophethood. We have considered arguments that are used to prove
              Muhammad’s prophethood, and we have concluded that they are quite
              problematic.
                   Though other Muslims and I often said that Muhammad ought to
              be followed because of his excellent character, I could not sustain that
              argument in the face of the counterevidence. Although Muhammad gave
              plenty of moral teachings and exhibited merciful and peaceful character
              at times, there are many other accounts of Muhammad’s brutality and
              exultation in war, his spiritual shortcomings, and his troubling treat-
              ment of women, among other concerns.
                   Also, there are no prophecies regarding Muhammad in the Bible.
              Reading the full context of the proposed passages and considering the
              meaning of their words carefully demonstrates that none of these pas-
              sages are prophecies.
                   Similarly, there is no miraculous scientific knowledge in either the
              Quran or the hadith. On the contrary, historical and textual context
              show every example to be flawed. In addition, many counterexamples of
              faulty science can be found in the texts of the Quran and the hadith that
              prohibit us from concluding that the text is miraculous.

                   ASSESSING THE RESPONSE
                                 HADITH VERSUS HISTORY




           T    he three reasons most commonly given by Muslims to accept
                Muhammad as a prophet—­his character, prophecies in the Bible,
           and miraculous scientific insights—­are all very problematic. As a result,
           we are left with no reason to believe that Muhammad was sent by God.
           This reasoning is incredibly straightforward.
               In simply setting out the arguments for Muhammad’s prophethood
           and considering them carefully, we have done something most Muslims
           never do. Generally speaking, most Muslims inherit a fulsome image of
           Muhammad from their parents and teachers during childhood and then
           assume that the stories they have always heard are true. That was the case
           for me, and since I had never really considered the arguments rationally,
           I did not respond to counterarguments rationally. Even though I had
           invited my friend David to study the matter with me, we often got into
           heated arguments while discussing Muhammad. I remember charging
           him with “dragging our prophet through the mud” more than once,
           when in actuality, I knew in my heart that I did not know how to handle
           what I was learning about Muhammad.
               The fact is most Muslims simply have not read the primary sources
           on Muhammad’s life, instead only hearing overviews that have filtered
           out the more problematic accounts. When they first hear these stories,
           they do not know how to react. When I began reading these accounts
           with my own eyes, I tried to resolve each one individually, searching
           out explanations and ways to account for or dismiss each account that
           challenged the image of the peaceful, noble Muhammad I knew.

                  Individual problematic accounts quickly became dozens of such
              stories, and within a matter of months I was trying to account for over a
              hundred traditions of Muhammad’s life that I simply could not believe
              were true. This is when I began to approach the life of Muhammad more
              systematically. How could I know which accounts of Muhammad’s life
              were reliable and which were not?


              HADITH SCIENCES AND THE HISTORICAL METHOD
              As Muslims, we knew it was a long time after Muhammad died before
              anything substantial was written about his life, but people did not cease
              talking about him. For over two hundred years, stories about the Islamic
              prophet were passed orally from person to person, and among the true
              accounts proliferated many fabrications. By the time a systematic effort
              was made to sort through them, over five hundred thousand accounts
              of Muhammad’s life were in popular circulation, and it is commonly
              estimated that the vast majority of them were false.
                  How can we know which accounts of Muhammad’s life are
              trustworthy?
                  At first, I assumed the classical Islamic method for assessing the
              authenticity of hadith. In the field of uloom al-­hadith, translated “the
              science of Muhammad’s sayings,” Muslim scholars grade individual
              accounts of Muhammad’s life based on criteria such as how well-­k nown
              an account was and who the people relaying it were. The most trust-
              worthy hadith are ultimately graded sahih, which means “true” or
              “authentic,” whereas the weakest hadith are labelled daeef (“weak”) or
              even maudu (“fabricated”).
                  Imam Bukhari and his student Imam Muslim were two highly
              respected scholars in the third century after Muhammad, and they
              collected only those hadith which they considered sahih and beyond
              dispute. Most Muslims consider their collections above reproach. In
              using only the hadith that they approved, I hoped that we could see
              Muhammad was the noble and peaceful man that I had always been
              taught, and that there were no problematic accounts in his life.
                  But this did not happen. Problematic accounts existed even amid




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 259                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

           260    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           the sahih collections; in fact, every single account in the previous chap-
           ter was either from the Quran or from the sahih collections of Imam
           Bukhari and Imam Muslim.
                I began asking imams to resolve these problematic accounts found
           in the sahih, and I also searched online to see how other Muslims
           responded to the criticisms. What I learned was that many were willing
           to accuse even the sahih collections of containing fabricated accounts,
           finding ways to dismiss those accounts that were considered authentic
           by the great Muslim scholars of old.
                It was then I realized they were playing a dangerous game. They were
           essentially finding ways to pick and choose from the ancient records which
           accounts were reliable and which were not, creating a Muhammad that they
           felt comfortable with.
                I did not want to do that. I wanted to know who Muhammad really
           was and whether I should follow him as my prophet, not to create a
           Muhammad in my mind that was worth following. I decided to recon-
           sider my approach and study Muhammad using the historical method
           instead of uloom al-­hadith. What were the earliest accounts written
           about Muhammad, and how soon were they written?
                It was then that I discovered some shocking facts about early Islam.
           First, people were not writing books in Arabic during Muhammad’s
           time. The first Arabic book to have been written was the Quran, and
           even that was turned into a written book only after Muhammad died.
           There was no such thing as written Arabic literature, only oral. This is
           because, second, people were still figuring out how to write Arabic. Arabic
           script was far from standardized, having been invented only a century
           or two before Muhammad’s time. For these reasons and others, third,
           no one wrote a biography of Muhammad’s life until about 140 years after
           Muhammad died. By that time, there were certainly no eyewitnesses of
           Muhammad’s life, and people were generations removed from the events
           they discussed. Could we trust such an account to be an unfiltered and
           accurate depiction of Muhammad?
                The first biography, Sirat Rasul Allah, was written by a man named
           Ibn Ishaq, but the book itself has actually been lost. Ibn Ishaq taught a
           man named al-­Bakkai, who made his own edition of Ibn Ishaq’s book,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 260                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

              and al-­Bakkai taught a man named Ibn Hisham, who edited al-­Bakkai’s
              edition, and it is this edition that we have today. Why did these men
              each make their own editions? Ibn Hisham tells us in his introductory
              remarks: “Things which it is disgraceful to discuss, matters which
              would distress certain people, and such reports as al-­Bakkai told me he
              could not accept as trustworthy—­a ll these things I have omitted.”1 In
              other words, the earliest biography of Muhammad’s life was reputed to
              contain fabrications, disgraceful material, and distressing facts.2 What
              we have today has been filtered many times, both for fabrications and
              for difficult truths.
                   It is because of such intentional editing that historians do not con-
              sider late accounts as trustworthy as early accounts, all else being equal.
              The earlier accounts have not been as filtered, and therefore are more
              likely to be true. Also, people are more prone to forget information over
              time, especially information that does not fit with the narrative at large.
              When it comes to the records of Muhammad’s life, we simply do not
              have such early or unfiltered data. Everything has been filtered through
              multiple generations.
                   Even though the earliest biography went through layers of filtering,
              it still contains shocking material. Muhammad personally oversaw the
              beheadings of up to nine hundred men on a single day, digging trenches
              in the marketplaces so that their corpses could fall into mass graves
              upon being decapitated;3 he ordered the assassination of an old man
              who had composed poetry complaining about Muhammad;4 a woman
              lamented the old man’s death in poetry, so Muhammad ordered her
              assassination, and her blood splattered on her children as she breastfed;5
              Muhammad ordered the torture of a city treasurer to extract the loca-
              tion of the money, so his men kindled a fire with flint and steel on the
              treasurer’s chest until he was nearly dead, ultimately beheading him;6
              when Muhammad was about to execute a man, the man pleaded, “Who
              will look after my children?” to which Muhammad responded, “Hell!” 7
              Just by scratching the surface of the earliest biography we find many
              troubling accounts of Muhammad.
                   By the time hadith were written under men like Imam Bukhari and
              Imam Muslim, many of these accounts were filtered out of Muhammad’s




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 261                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           262    Is Muhammad a Prophet of God?

           biography, just as Ibn Hisham and al-­Bakkai had filtered the accounts
           that they received. For this reason, selective filtration, the whole body of
           hadith is inherently flawed: They contain only those accounts that multiple
           generations of early Muslims each chose to save. As we have seen, even
           those that were kept are often considered flawed and fabricated.


           WHAT CAN WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT MUHAMMAD?
           For this reason, non-­Muslim scholars of early Islam are very hesitant to
           trust the information about the life of Muhammad. Almost none accept
           the science of hadith criticism as it stands, most just hoping to extract
           historical kernels of truth from the hadith. Some scholars have even
           abandoned hope of that much success, saying virtually nothing can be
           known about Muhammad. These scholars are from a variety of religious
           and nonreligious backgrounds. One Muslim scholar concluded that, given
           the nature of the evidence, Muhammad may not have even existed.
               Muhammad Sven Kalisch completed his PhD in Islamic jurispru-
           dence in 1997 and became Germany’s first professor to hold a chair
           in Islamic theology. When he arrived at Münster University in 2004,
           he struck some as too conservative on account of his zeal for sharia.
           But then, according to the Wall Street Journal, Kalisch “wanted to sub-
           ject Islam to the same scrutiny as Christianity and Judaism.”8 At first
           he defended the historicity of Muhammad in print, but the more he
           studied, the more he realized there were significant problems with the
           record. The word Muhammad appears only four times in the Quran,
           and it is unclear whether it is a name or a title. Quran 61.6 appears to
           say that the Prophet’s name was Ahmad, not Muhammad.9 There is no
           other evidence of Muhammad’s existence until the turn of the eighth
           century, when coins bearing his name were produced. “The more I read,
           the historical person at the root of the whole thing became more and
           more improbable,” says Muhammad Kalisch.
               Other scholars are coming to similar conclusions on account of the
           holes in the historical records. Their concerns are more than an argu-
           ment from silence; if the traditional understanding of Islam is true, it is
           indeed very problematic that we do not find more about Muhammad

              in the earliest historical records. If Muhammad was the prophet of the
              Arabs, and if they were energized and motivated by his teachings, why is
              it that the Arab conquests of the Middle East, North Africa, and Persia
              never mention his name? These conquests occurred in the middle of the
              seventh century, immediately after Muhammad’s death, yet none of the
              contemporary records mention Muhammad. In fact, none mention a
              holy book or even the word Muslim. It is not that there are no records;
              considering the communications of the conquerors and the writings of
              the conquered, there are abundant records, yet Muhammad is never
              named, a holy book is never discussed, and the conquerors are never
              called Muslims.
                   Other evidence also has historians scratching their heads: Although
              Mecca is reputed to be a trade center, it never appears in any trade routes
              until the turn of the eighth century; none of the earliest mosques faced
              toward Mecca (all faced toward either Jerusalem or Petra until about
              the turn of the eighth century); Mecca is mentioned only once in the
              Quran; the descriptions of the land in the Quran sound very little like
              Mecca, much more like northern Arabia; and the list goes on.
                   For these reasons, not just one Muslim scholar but many schol-
              ars doubt the traditional origins of Islam and even the existence
              of Muhammad, at least as the early Islamic records describe him.
              According to them, the truth about the origins of Islam is unfortunately
              veiled. There is almost nothing we can know with certainty about the
              historical Muhammad.10

                                  THE DILEMMA OF THE
                                 HISTORICAL MUHAMMAD




           B     oth as a Muslim and now ten years later, I did not conclude that
                 Muhammad did not exist. Given the sheer volume of stories and
           accounts, as well as their relative coherence, it seems more probable than
           not to me that Muhammad existed. But I do have to agree with the basic
           consensus of non-­Muslim scholarship: We cannot know much about
           Muhammad with certainty.
                The alternative, of course, is to trust the Islamic records of
           Muhammad’s life, the hadith and sirah. But if we consider their
           accuracy according to the standards of uloom al-­hadith, we still find a
           Muhammad who is not compelling as a prophet of God. Perhaps he was
           a great seventh-­century general and one who adhered to the cultural
           standards of his day, but he certainly was not the greatest moral exem-
           plar of all time nor one to whom I would declare my allegiance. If we
           abandon the uloom al-­hadith and use the historical method of assessing
           the earliest biographies and accounts of Muhammad’s life, we find an
           even more brutal and problematic picture of Muhammad.
                This is the dilemma I had as a Muslim: Either I could trust the his-
           torical sources of Muhammad’s life and find a man I would never want to
           follow as a prophet, or I could question the sources and have no reason to
           consider him a prophet. Either way I could not conclude, based on the
           evidence, that Muhammad was a prophet of God.

                                                                           Conclusion   265


              A DISTURBANCE IN THE SHAHADA
              Much like Professor Muhammad Sven Kalisch, I was confident in my
              Islam and in following Muhammad until I used the same critical stand-
              ards to study his life as I did to study the life of Jesus. While critically
              studying Jesus’ claim to be God, I had been willing to discard John’s
              gospel because it was written fifty-­f ive or sixty years after Jesus’ death,
              even though eyewitnesses of Jesus’ life would still have been alive at that
              time and in that community. If I treated the accounts of Muhammad’s
              life the same way, I would have to throw out absolutely everything, and
              I would have no basis to consider him my prophet.
                   But the records of his life left me with a dilemma: If I did believe the
              records to be reliable, then there was no way I could follow Muhammad
              as a prophet. His character was certainly not so excellent that it compelled
              us to believe he was a prophet. He had many spiritual shortcomings, and
              he was very violent throughout his ministry, among other concerns. Nor
              did the records indicate that God had sanctioned his ministry: He was
              not prophesied in the Bible and he did not have any remarkable depth
              of insight into science.
                   Crestfallen, I came to the conclusion that there was simply no way
              I could declare Muhammad a prophet of God based on the historical
              record. I could no longer recite the shahada without a sharp pang of
              doubt, and it haunted me.
                   The only way for me to continue following Muhammad was through
              the Quran. If it could be shown that the Quran is the Word of God,
              then the one who delivered it would have to be a messenger of God. I
              clung to the hope that my investigation of the Quran not only would
              vindicate Muhammad but also would completely outshine the evidence
              for Christianity.

                                THE POSITIVE CASE
                            THERE IS NO OTHER BOOK LIKE IT




              T     he Quran is the jewel of Islam. The “why” of Muslim belief, it
                    is the prize of Muhammad and the foundation of the faith. Its
              place in Islamic theology is that of Jesus in Christian theology, and as
              a Muslim, my confidence was built on nothing less than the text of the
              Quran and its excellence.
                  We inherited our high view of the Quran from the Muslims around
              us and our world of tradition. I grew up memorizing its chapters by
              hearing portions read aloud during the daily prayers and by being
              quizzed on it by my mother daily. That is how I had the last seven
              chapters of the Quran memorized by the age of five, and the last fifteen
              chapters memorized by the age of fifteen. While I was more acquainted
              with the Quran than most Muslims I knew, I certainly was not out of
              the ordinary. Some in our Islamic community had the entire Quran
              memorized by their teenage years.
                  We regarded the Quran more highly than any other physical object
              in the world. After all, we believed it was the Word of God.
                  When I began losing my historical confidence in the prophethood
              of Muhammad, I placed all my hope on the pillar of the Quran, believ-
              ing it would stand firm enough to authenticate Muhammad’s prophetic
              status. In all honesty, I truly was convinced it would stand firm because
              I had heard many arguments for its inspiration.




                                                                                   269

           270    Is the Quran the Word of God?


           THE LITERARY EXCELLENCE OF THE QURAN
           A deeply held belief of devout Muslims is that the excellence of the
           Quran is unsurpassed, that it is inimitable in its literary quality. This is
           inherently true not only because it is an expression of Allah, the Word
           of God on earth, but also because the Quran says so. When people
           charged Muhammad to prove that the Quran was inspired by God,
           the response came: “This Quran could not be produced by any other
           than Allah . . . Do they say, ‘he has invented it’? Say, ‘then bring a surah
           like it’ ” (10.37–38).
               Thus, the Quran challenges skeptics to try their hand at making
           something equal or better, asserting that no one but Allah could com-
           pose a recitation so excellent. They will never be able to do it, not even
           if they had the help of every man and every demon: “If mankind and
           jinn gathered to bring something similar to this Quran, they could not”
           (17.88). The basic challenge is repeated multiple times in the Quran.1
               According to Muslims, this challenge was made to skeptical Arabs
           who were experts in poetry. They were never able to produce anything
           as excellent and compelling as the Quran, and the challenge thus stands
           to this day.


           THE FULFILLED PROPHECIES OF THE QURAN
           If the Quran can be shown to contain fulfilled prophecies, then we have
           good reason to believe it is from God. One of the clearest prophecies is
           found in sura 30, the chapter on the Romans. In it, the Quran mentions
           a recent loss of the Roman Empire, predicting that the Romans would
           ultimately regroup, defeating their enemies within the next few years
           (30.2–4). This is exactly what happened. The Persians defeated the
           Romans in 614, but Emperor Heraclius ultimately defeated the Persians
           in 622.
               Other prophecies, more long-­term in their predictions, have also
           come true. For example, the Quran says, “Their skins testify against
           them as to what they used to do” (41.20). Reading the verse, one would
           wonder how skin can testify against a man. Muhammad could never




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 270                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                   The Positive Case   271

              have known about fingerprint analysis, that people’s skin could testify
              against them. This verse is therefore a prophecy that has come true in
              modern times.
                  Many more prophecies such as these two, prophecies of events in
              both ancient and modern times, confirm that the Quran is the Word
              of God.


              THE MIRACULOUS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE QURAN
              Muslims often argue that there is miraculous scientific knowledge in the
              Quran. In addition to the examples in chapter 33, Muslims often argue
              that the Quran speaks of the big bang in 21.30, which says, “Have the
              disbelievers not known that the universe was a singularity, and we tore it
              apart?” In addition to the miraculous astronomic insight, the verse goes
              on to show miraculous biological insight: “We made every living thing
              out of water.”
                  Muhammad could not have known about the big bang nor about
              the fact that water is essential to all forms of life. The best explanation
              of this miraculous scientific knowledge is that the Quran must have
              come from Allah.


              THE MATHEMATICAL MARVELS OF THE QURAN
              Although it was not an argument that I ever used, many Muslims argue
              that the Quran displays mathematical marvels that could only be the
              result of God’s authorship. One kind of mathematical marvel is numer-
              ical parallels: the word month appears twelve times in the Quran, the
              word day appears 365 times, the words man and woman appear an equal
              number of times, the words angels and Satan appear an equal number
              of times, and the words this world and the hereafter appear an equal
              number of times. Such numerical parallels could only be the result of a
              divine mind behind the text.
                  In addition to these patterns, there is a hidden code in the Quran.
              In 74.30, the Quran says “over it are nineteen.” When we analyze the
              text of the Quran for patterns, we start finding the number nineteen




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 271                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           272    Is the Quran the Word of God?

           everywhere. For just a few examples, the total number of chapters in
           the Quran is divisible by nineteen; the first revelation of the Quran had
           nineteen words; and the first chapter chronologically revealed has nine-
           teen verses and a total number of words divisible by nineteen. Dozens
           of such examples can be found, and the number nineteen is not a small
           prime number, making it very difficult for a text to exhibit this as a
           common pattern. Given the Quranic verse about the number nineteen,
           the oddity of the number, and the prevalence of the pattern, we can be
           confident that Allah is the author of this text.


           THE PERFECT PRESERVATION OF THE QURAN
           One argument more essential to Muslim faith than all the others is the
           perfect preservation of the Quran. Every single word, every single letter,
           every single stroke of the Quran remains exactly as it was revealed, from
           Allah to Muhammad down to our day. It is an essential belief because
           of the view of the Quran in Islam: It is the eternal expression of Allah,
           so it can never change. Its immutability is also necessary because it is the
           foundation of sharia, a law for all time.
                This is miraculous proof of the Quran’s inspiration because it
           was prophesied in the Quran: “Surely we have revealed the Reminder
           (Qur’an) and we will surely be its guardian” (15.9). And since we
           believed that every other holy book has been corrupted by its followers,
           this miracle is all the more potent.


           CONCLUDING THE POSITIVE CASE
           In our circles, the Quran really was above dispute. For multiple reasons,
           the Muslim community is convinced beyond any doubt that it is the
           Word of God: Its text is inimitably excellent, it foretells prophecies that
           have been fulfilled, it holds hidden scientific truths waiting to be dis-
           covered, its marvelously calculated text could only be the product of a
           divine mind, and the text has been preserved perfectly, down to the very
           stroke of the scribes’ pens.
               Such were the arguments in which we had always placed our faith,




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 272                                                 7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                  The Positive Case   273

              and I had been convinced of their strength my entire life. When it
              became the only remaining pillar of my faith, though, I had to scrutinize
              these arguments with much more precision than ever before. They were
              now the sole foundation of my faith, and I had to be certain whether
              they could bear the weight of my entire Islamic worldview.

                                            Chapter 38



                                   THE RESPONSE
                       IN WHAT WAY IS THAT MIRACULOUS?




           W       hen I began my investigation of the Quran, I was more than
                   convinced that it was the Word of Allah, but I needed to be able
           to show that an objective investigator would also find the case convincing.
               That is where the case started crumbling.


           THE LITERARY EXCELLENCE OF THE QURAN: A FLAWED TEST
           One of the first things that became apparent was that the Quran’s own
           defense of its inspiration—­the challenge to write a revelation like it—­is
           virtually impossible to assess.
               I vividly remember Mike Licona’s response when I told him of
           the Quran’s challenge. “I’ve seen better writing than the Quran,” he
           responded nonchalantly. “Have you ever read Psalm 23?” Shocked at his
           brazen assertion, I retorted that Psalm 23 was not of the caliber of the
           Quran, but he simply disagreed with me, saying it was one of the most
           powerful passages ever composed, more moving than anything he had
           read in the Quran.
               That is when I took a step back and reassessed the test. What is it
           really asking? I began to think that it must be the Arabic of the Quran
           that was inimitable, not the English translation or interpretations. But
           did that mean that this test was limited to Arabic speakers?
               That could not be the case either. People who had specifically set
           out to respond to the Quran’s challenge had already composed a book
           of Christian teachings in Arabic called the Furqan al-­Haqq, “The True

           274




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 274                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                       The Response   275

              Discernment.” They included many teachings of the Psalms in this
              Arabic book, writing them in the style of the Quran. Their results were
              so convincing that they read the text aloud, chanting it in Quranic style,
              in the middle of Arab Muslim cities. Many who passed would hear the
              recitation and, confusing it for the Quran, thank the readers for reciting
              it. Clearly, then, the test did not work for Arabic speakers either, not
              even Arab Muslims.
                  Researching the issue online, I found Muslim apologists arguing
              that the Arabs who had mistaken the Furqan al-­Haqq were probably
              unlearned, so they had not grasped the lofty beauty of the Quran. An
              expert in Arabic would find the text of the Quran inimitable.
                  It was then that I found the assessment of a scholar, Gerd Puin,
              whose expertise is on the Arabic orthography of the Quran. Puin
              argued that “every fifth sentence or so simply doesn’t make sense.”1
              Preemptively defending his assertion, Puin adds, “Many Muslims—­
              and Orientalists—­will tell you otherwise, of course, but the fact is that
              a fifth of the Koranic text is just incomprehensible.”2 To this, Muslim
              apologists responded that Gerd Puin was not a native Arabic speaker;
              the Quran needed to be assessed by an expert in Arabic who is himself
              an Arab and has grown up speaking Arabic.
                  With every step, it seemed that the test was being redefined to
              somehow protect it from scrutiny, but this leads us to ask the question:
              In what way is this challenge pertinent to us? If it is only for Arabic
              speakers, it serves no proof for the vast majority of people in the world
              today; if people have to be experts in classical Arabic, then it is relevant
              only to a very small number of people in human history.
                  Of course, all this is apart from the subjectivity of the test and its
              ultimately non-­sequitur nature: Who is to say whether one composition
              is more excellent than another? By what measure? The Quran certainly
              does not set the parameters the apologists do. And even if it were ascer-
              tained that the Quran is the best writing mankind has ever seen, that
              does not mean it is inspired. Stradivarius, a man who lived from the
              mid-1600s to the 1700s, is reputed to have made the most acoustically
              perfect violins the world has ever heard; not even with our modern
              technology have we been able to reproduce their perfection.3 Were he to




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 275                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

           276    Is the Quran the Word of God?

           have said that his violins were made by God and offered their matchless
           quality as evidence, we would have thought him a lunatic or a liar. In
           what way does an excellent product prove divine origin?
               For these reasons, the literary excellence of the Quran is a flawed
           test, and as I found with Mike, it is unconvincing to non-­Muslims—­the
           very people for whom it is intended. An objective investigator would not
           be convinced.


           THE PROPHECIES OF THE QURAN: NOT REALLY PROPHECIES
           When we consider the prophecies of the Quran carefully, we conclude
           there are virtually none to even test. As an example, let us consider the
           claim that 41.20 is a prophecy about fingerprints. The full context of
           the verse reads, “And (make mention of) the day when the enemies of
           Allah are gathered unto the Fire, they are driven on till, when they reach
           it, their ears and their eyes and their skins testify against them as to
           what they used to do. And they say unto their skins: Why testify ye
           against us? They say: Allah hath given us speech, Who giveth speech to
           all things” (41.19–21).
                By reading the context we find that the Quran is actually speaking
           about the day of judgment, that skin will speak with a voice, along with
           eyes and ears. It is not a prophecy of something that will happen on
           earth but an apocalyptic description of judgment. Only by wrenching
           this verse from its context and forcing a contrived meaning upon it can
           this verse be made to sound like a prophecy for our time.
                Of course, we can do this with just about any text if we try hard
           enough, and it is easier with apocalyptic texts such as this one. For
           example, I have just now opened the Bible to a random section of the
           book of Revelation, and my finger landed on 11:8, which says, “Their
           bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—­which is figura-
           tively called Sodom and Egypt.” I can argue that this was a miraculous
           prophecy of the Arab Spring that describes the aftermath of the Tahrir
           Square demonstrations that took place in January 2011, leading to
           over eight hundred people killed. Moreover, the city of Cairo, where
           Tahrir Square is located, is often referred to figuratively as Egypt in




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 276                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                         The Response   277

              the Arabic language (Misr). Thus, eight hundred bodies laid in Tahrir
              Square, a public square in the great city that is figuratively called Egypt.
              Revelation 11:8 prophesies the event with extreme precision almost two
              thousand years ahead of time.
                    Of course, that is not what the text is prophesying, and I have just
              made all this up on the spot, but I could make the case appear convinc-
              ing if I really wanted to, especially if I take the verse out of context. This
              is exactly what we see with the vast majority of so-­called prophecies
              in the Quran. There is no reason to think the Quran is making any
              of these so-­called prophecies. That is not to say there may not be hid-
              den prophetic meaning in the text of the Quran, but in order to be a
              prophecy that convinces an objective investigator, it needs to meet the
              minimum criterion that it is obviously a prophecy, not text that can be
              turned into one.
                    For example, the passage about the Roman victory in 30.2–4 actually
              does appear to be a prophecy, the clearest example of a prophecy in the
              Quran, so it is worth considering more carefully. There are two minor
              problems with considering this a fulfilled prophecy, and two major
              problems. Briefly, the first minor problem is the nature of the prophecy;
              it is not much of a prediction. Given the ongoing nature of the Byzantine-­
              Persian conflicts at the time, there was bound to be a Byzantine victory at
              some point. It is almost like saying, “The Chicago Bulls have just lost to
              the LA Lakers, but the Bulls will be ultimately victorious.”4
                    The second minor problem is the number of years it took for the
              Byzantines to be victorious; the verse of the Quran uses a word that
              implies ten years or less, but it took seventeen years for the Romans to
              ultimately defeat the Byzantines.
                    There are two much more significant problems with using this as
              prophetic fulfillment. First, Quranic verses were regularly abrogated,
              and the Byzantine victory came during Muhammad’s lifetime. Had it
              looked as if it were not going to happen, the text could easily have been
              abrogated.5
                    Second, and along the same vein, the Quran was not collected in a
              book until even later. Had this prophecy failed, it could have been left
              out of the final collection of the text, as other verses had.6




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 277                                                  7/1/16 1:57 PM

           278    Is the Quran the Word of God?

               So this example of a Quranic prophecy, the best that the text has to
           offer, is not convincing. It is essentially a 50/50 prediction that could
           have easily been taken back, and if we consider the text literally, it
           appears that it did not come true anyway, as the Byzantines did not
           defeat the Persians until after the prophesied time had elapsed.


           THE MIRACULOUS SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
           CONSIDERING TEXT AND CONTEXT
           While considering the prophethood of Muhammad, we already saw
           that the Quran contains scientific inaccuracies—­such as the setting of
           the sun in water and the production of sperm between the backbone
           and the ribs—­which are enough to cause serious doubt that the Quran
           is scientifically miraculous. As before, simply investigating the text and
           the context of such supposed miraculous knowledge is usually enough
           to conclude that this is not a convincing argument.
                That rule of thumb turns out to be true here as well. Looking again
           at 21.30 of the Quran, the text actually reads, “Have not those who
           disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then
           We parted them.” It does not say that the universe was a singularity, but
           rather that the heavens and earth were joined and God separated them.
           This is actually just an approximation of what God was doing in Genesis
           1:6—nothing new or specific to the Quran. Similarly, the notion that
           all living creatures are made of water is not that difficult to postulate,
           as humans and animals all drink water, and very little survives in the
           desert where there is not much water. Finally, it might be worth know-
           ing that the Quran frequently asserts that jinn were made from fire, not
           water, and some would consider this a contradiction within the Quran.7
                So these examples, as before, are shown to be far from convincing
           when we consider the actual text of the verse, the historical context of
           the science claims, and the accuracy of what the Quran asserts. There is
           no miraculous scientific knowledge in the Quran.

                                                                      The Response   279


              MATHEMATICAL MARVELS:
              IN WHAT WAY ARE THEY SPECIAL?
              Although many Muslims find the argument from mathematical pat-
              terns compelling, I honestly never did. All sorts of amazing patterns
              can be found in the world around us if we simply look for them. This
              is true of the natural world, as anyone who has considered the golden
              ratio will attest, and it is true of manmade products as well. Searching
              for patterns in Moby Dick, for example, one can find predictions of the
              future, including the assassinations of Leon Trotsky, Martin Luther
              King Jr., John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, and Princess Diana.8 If
              you look hard enough, and if you can fudge the parameters, you will
              find patterns.
                   And we know that the person who “discovered” the pattern of the
              number nineteen in the Quran was doing just that. Rashad Khalifa, the
              person who first published the pattern of the number nineteen, used
              about 250 pages to defend fifty-­two different ways that the number
              nineteen was found in the text of the Quran. According to a popular
              Muslim scholar, Bilal Philips, “Most Muslims readily and unquestion-
              ingly accepted Khalifa’s claims as they had the aura of ‘scientific fact’
              about them.” But some Muslims emphatically decried the argument
              from the number nineteen, pointing out the great flaws in Khalifa’s
              arguments and reasoning. Philips himself penned an entire treatise
              against it, called “The Qur’an’s Numerical Miracle.”9
                   In it, Philips says, “The Theory of Nineteen is a shoddily concocted
              hoax unable to withstand serious scientific scrutiny.”10 Part of Philips’s
              response to Khalifa pertains to the Quranic verse Khalifa quotes,
              74.30–31. Reading the full text in this case clarifies that the number
              nineteen refers to the number of angels who are wardens over the hellfire,
              not at all to miraculous patterns in the text of the Quran. As we have
              seen others do with Quranic “prophecies,” Khalifa simply wrenched the
              words out of their context and tried to fit them to his theory.
                   Another part of Philips’s response relates to the inconsistent method
              and arbitrary selections required to argue for the number nineteen.
              “By Using Dr. Khalifa’s inconsistent method of concocting multiples,”




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 279                                              7/1/16 1:57 PM

           280    Is the Quran the Word of God?

           argues Philips, “it is also possible to establish 8 as the axis of the Qur’an’s
           miraculous numerical code,” and he goes on to give eight reasons why.
               The majority of Philips’ response to Khalifa’s argument, though, is
           systematically analyzing Khalifa’s publications and calculations, con-
           cluding that Khalifa had “fabricated data in order to artificially create
           letter totals which are multiples of nineteen.” Not only does Khalifa
           inconsistently count letters and verses, following “a haphazard system
           of word identification that totally contradicts both classical and modern
           rules of Arabic grammar,” but also he is willing to go as far as discard-
           ing two verses from the Quran in order to make his calculations work.
           Philips’s arguments against the “miraculous pattern” are convincing, as
           is his conclusion that Khalifa was willing to tamper with the Quranic
           text simply to make the data fit.
               In a similar way, the arguments of marvelous numerical parallels
           appear to treat the text inconsistently and tamper with the wording.
           The Quran does not use the word day 365 times, for example. It uses it
           360 times, and to make the other five work, proponents of the argument
           have to fudge the data, allowing words to count that are not exactly
           the word day. The same is true for the number of times month is used,
           and the supposedly parallel occurrences of man/woman and this world/
           hereafter. Since Arabic is a Semitic language and uses a triliteral root
           system for its words, different words are very similar to one another in
           spelling, and this is often used to the advantage of those who would be
           willing to “massage the data” to make their argument work.
               To summarize our response to the argument from marvelous mathe-
           matical patterns, I will quote Philips’s final words: “It may be concluded
           that the theory of nineteen as a miraculous numerical code for the
           Qur’an has no basis in the Qur’an itself and the few instances where
           nineteen and its multiples do occur are merely coincidences which have
           been blown out of proportion.”11 The same can be said for all the math-
           ematical marvels found in the Quran.

                                                                       The Response   281


              PERFECT PRESERVATION OF THE QURANIC TEXT:
              IN WHAT WAY HAS IT BEEN PERFECTLY PRESERVED?
              Finally, though we had firm faith in the perfect preservation of the
              Quran, the fact is that it is impossible to prove. When Uthman pro-
              duced an official, edited copy of the Quran and destroyed all the other
              copies, he left future historians no means to determine whether today’s
              Quran actually goes back to Muhammad.12 Uthman destroyed all the
              evidence, and it appears he did so precisely because there were variants.13
                  Despite the fact that perfect preservation cannot be proven, it can be
              disproven to a significant degree. In the first place, the Quranic text was
              not always written but sometimes just known by memory. It was for this
              reason that Umar convinced Abu Bakr to collect a copy of the Quran
              in the first place. Many Qurra (reciters of the Quran) were dying on
              battlefields, and Umar said, “I am afraid that more heavy casualties may
              take place among the Qurra’ on other battlefields, whereby a large part
              of the Qur’an may be lost.”14 If the Quran had been written, why would
              he fear its loss by the death of its reciters?
                  The fact is that portions of the Quran were not in writing, and it
              had to be collected from people’s memories. This is said explicitly in
              Sahih Bukhari: The Quran was collected from “palmed stalks, thin
              white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart.” The same
              hadith tells us that at least two verses were known by only one person:
              “I started searching for the Qur’an till I found the last two Verses of
              Surat at-­Tauba with Abi Khuza’ima Al-­A nsari and I could not find these
              Verses with anybody other than him.”15 In other words, two verses of
              the Quran have been included on the testimony of just one individual.16
              Had he not remembered those verses, they would have been lost, and we
              would all have been none the wiser.
                  Sahih Bukhari mentions that a verse was missed the first time the
              Quran was written, and it had to be found later: “A verse from Surat
              Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Qur’an and I used to hear
              Allah’s Messenger reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with
              Khuza’ima bin Thabit Al-­A nsari.”17 It appears that verses kept being
              forgotten and lost, just barely being recovered.

           282    Is the Quran the Word of God?

               Muhammad himself used to say that Muslims tended to forget
           Quranic verses very easily. “Keep on reciting the Qur’an because it
           escapes from the hearts of men faster than camel do.”18 He was not
           exaggerating, as even he forgot verses of the Quran. Upon hearing a
           man reciting the Quran at night he said, “May Allah bestow His Mercy
           on him, as he has reminded me of verses which I forgot.”19
               If, according to the most trustworthy traditions, parts of the Quran
           were known by only one person, and other parts were missed, and
           indeed Muslims forgot verses, could it not be that some parts of the
           Quran were left out altogether? Can we really say such a precarious text
           has been perfectly preserved?
               Unfortunately, we cannot. Sahih Bukhari puts the nail in the coffin
           by recording this hadith: “Umar said, ‘Ubay was the best of us in the
           recitation of the Qur’an yet we leave out some of what he recites.’ Ubay
           says, ‘I have taken it from the mouth of Allah’s Messenger and will
           not leave it out for anything whatever.’ ”20 So the very best reciter of
           the Quran was adamant that verses of the Quran have been left out.21
           Muhammad himself chose Ubay as one of the best teachers of the
           Quran,22 and yet he disagreed with today’s Quran.
               To summarize, not only is there no way to prove that the Quran has
           been perfectly preserved, but it appears to have been disproved: Portions
           are missing, and one of the greatest teachers of the Quran, hand selected
           by Muhammad, disagreed with today’s edition of the Quran. There is
           much, much more to be said against the argument from perfect preser-
           vation, but we have confined ourselves to just that evidence present in
           Sahih Bukhari, and not even all of that.23
               Finally, as we saw in chapter 14, the text of the Quran was under-
           going abrogation. Muhammad would cancel certain older verses and
           replace them with newer verses. The Quran itself testifies to this in
           2.106 and 16.101. Muslims may be able to accept this phenomenon as
           a divine mandate, and they are well within their rights to do so, but to
           an objective investigator it strongly challenges the case of perfect pres-
           ervation. Rather, the phenomenon of abrogation makes the text of the
           Quran appear very artificial and man-­made.
               Of course, even if the Quran were perfectly preserved, that is not




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 282                                               7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                     The Response   283

              necessarily a miracle. Many texts have been unchanged throughout
              the ages. But given the abrogation of its text, the missing sections, the
              portions that had been forgotten, and the controlled destruction of all
              variants, an objective investigator is forced to ask, “In what way is the
              preservation of the Quran miraculous?”


              CONCLUDING THE RESPONSE TO THE POSITIVE CASE
              The arguments for the divine inspiration of the Quran all prove uncon-
              vincing when we begin to dig beneath the surface. The literary excellence
              of the Quran proves to be untestable, subjective, and non-­sequitur; the
              prophecies of the Quran are not compelling; the science of the Quran
              is actually problematic; the numerical patterns are often distorted data
              combined with exaggerated interpretations; and the Quran has not been
              preserved in any miraculous sense.
                  Because there is no compelling argument, there is no reason to
              accept the Quran as the Word of God.

                   ASSESSING THE RESPONSE
                       WHAT KIND OF BOOK IS THE QURAN?




           W        hen assessing these counterarguments as a Muslim, my immediate
                    response was to bring more evidence to the table, and to provide
           more examples of fulfilled prophecies and more examples of miracu-
           lously scientific knowledge. We had heard dozens of such examples at
           the mosques throughout our lives. Surely if the first few examples were
           not convincing, then one of the many others would compel.
               It took months of bringing example after example to the table before I
           finally realized that, indeed, they all succumb to the same basic critiques.
               It was a different process altogether when I came to learn about the
           history of the Quranic text. In that case, it was not a series of examples
           that was called into question, but a foundational narrative of my Muslim
           faith. We had learned from everyone, not just imams in the mosque but
           our parents and elders and books that we had read, that the Quran was
           absolutely perfect in its transmission. Muhammad had relayed it to his
           scribes, the scribes had written it down and memorized it, the Muslim
           people treasured it in their hearts and recited it regularly during the
           prayers, and it was readily written down and preserved. All copies today
           are exactly the same.
               That is what we had been told. But as I read Sahih Bukhari, specifi-
           cally the book titled The Virtues of the Quran, it became clear to me that
           a great deal of the evidence had been left out of the narrative I inherited.
               The truth about the Quranic text and its history is shocking to
           Muslims when I share it with them today, but it is well documented.
           Arabic writing was far from perfected during the time of Muhammad,

           284

              which is why there was no such thing as a written Arabic book.1 When
              initially writing the text of the Quran, letters and vowel markings were
              still being standardized, which led to confusion. For these reasons, what
              the scribes wrote were memory aids for the oral text. This is actually a
              fairly uncontroversial fact even among Muslim Quran scholars.
                   What is controversial is the result of this: The text of the Quran was
              fluid during the time of Muhammad. He would recite the same verse
              multiple ways, saying he could do so up to seven ways.2 If at any point
              a text needed to be canceled, it could simply be abrogated and replaced
              with another text. Since the text of the Quran was not seen as a written
              text, this caused little problem: All that was required was to stop reciting
              certain verses and to “forget” what had been revealed.3
                   An advantage of a written text is that clear boundaries must be
              delineated; the book starts with a certain verse and ends with a certain
              verse. With an oral text that is being recited in portions, repeated in
              different ways, abrogated at times, and never publicly read in full from
              start to finish, it is difficult to determine what the exact contents are.
              For this reason, when the Quran was finally written down, there were
              many disagreements about its canon. We have already seen that the
              final version of the Quran was problematic to Ubay, who said portions
              were missing, and Ubay was one of the best teachers of the Quran.
              According to early Islamic sources, Ubay had two chapters at the end
              of his Quran that are not in the modern Quran: surat al-­Hafd and
              surat al-­K hal.4 Ubay was not alone in including these chapters, as at
              least two other companions of Muhammad believed them to be a part
              of the Quran.5
                   But Ubay was not the best teacher of the Quran. When giving a list
              of the four best teachers of the Quran, Muhammad named Abdullah
              ibn Masud first.6 He disagreed with Ubay, saying that Ubay’s final two
              chapters were divine revealed prayers, not scripture. On that very same
              basis, though, he disagreed with the modern Quran, insisting that sura
              1 as well as suras 113 and 114 are divinely revealed prayers, not portions
              of the Quran. He left them out of his final version, limiting his canon
              to 111 suras.7
                   Today’s Quran, which was not put together by one of the teachers

           286    Is the Quran the Word of God?

           Muhammad named, is but one of multiple Quranic canons, the one
           that received official approval by the caliphate and became the standard
           text when the rest were burned.
               When that happened, the Quran went from a primarily oral text to
           a primarily written text, and what was recited from memory before was
           read from a page now. The Arabic script, unperfected as yet, needed to
           be standardized and finalized. The Quran is what drove the develop-
           ment of this standard Arabic script.
               Three hundred years after Muhammad died, Arabic script had been
           more or less standardized, so a scholar with significant authority, Ibn
           Mujahid, ordered that all but seven different readings be made illegal.
           Some of his elders disagreed with him, as they had been reading the
           Quran from their childhood in a reading that was now deemed illegal,
           and they continued reading the Quran the way they always had. One
           of these, Ibn Shanabudh, was beaten until he publicly recanted.8 This
           is how the proliferation of different Quranic readings was controlled.
               However, those seven readings each proliferated once more as they
           were read according to different receivers, until around 1924, when
           the Muslim world produced its first Arabic Quran. The Royal Cairo
           Edition picked one of eighty readings for mass production, the reading
           of Hafs according to Asim; and this is the Quran that most of the world
           knows today. Some of the Muslim world, however, still has Qurans
           according to other readings, such as the reading of Warsh according to
           Nafi. There are some significant differences in meaning between these
           Qurans, but the vast majority are insignificant—­usually just differences
           in vocalization. Regardless, few Muslims realize that only one hundred
           years before, there were about eighty different readings of the Quran in
           the Muslim world, and that there are significant differences in Qurans
           even today.
               That is the true history of the Quran, not at all what we had been
           told by our elders and at mosques. The Quran started as an oral text,
           was transformed into a written text that was not unanimously agreed
           upon, and has been shaped and crafted by human authority even into
           the twentieth century.
               The Quran’s textual transmission is pockmarked by human artifice

              and intervention, and none of the other arguments for the Quran’s
              inspiration bear the weight of scrutiny. Truly, there is no argument
              that compels the objective investigator into believing that the Quran is
              divinely inspired.

                                            Chapter 40



                                      CONCLUSION
                     THERE IS NO COMPELLING REASON TO
                    THINK THE QURAN IS THE WORD OF GOD




           A     s I studied each of the arguments for the Quran’s inspiration, a
                 pattern became clear: I could find reason enough to defend my
           faith in the Quran, but it was beyond doubt that not a single one of the
           arguments could stand on its own merit and compel a careful investiga-
           tor who did not already believe Islam.
               Could I continue believing the Quran was literarily excellent
           beyond any other book? Of course I could, dismissing assessments like
           that of my friend Mike or the scholar Gerd Puin. Could I believe that
           the Quran has miraculous prophetic knowledge? Yes, I could find such
           knowledge in the text, even if it was not apparent to others. Could I
           believe the Quran was miraculously preserved? Yes, I could assume that
           Allah had guided the Quran in all its shaping and evolving to keep it
           true to its original text.
               But not a single one of the arguments is compelling to an objective
           investigator. The Quran cannot be used as miraculous proof to convince
           someone who has carefully scrutinized the evidence.
               And that was me: someone who wanted to believe in the inspiration
           of the Quran but would do so only if the evidence was strong. After
           carefully considering the five most common arguments, I saw that, far
           from being so strong that they can vindicate the faith, they actually
           need to be vindicated by faith.

                        ISLAM OR CHRISTIANITY?
                         THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR

              ASSESSING THE CASE FOR ISLAM AND ITS
              EFFORTS TO ACCOUNT FOR ISLAMIC ORIGINS
              To be a Muslim, one must confess the shahada: “There is no God
              but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.” The best way to assess
              the truth of the shahada is by investigating the prophetic status of
              Muhammad and the claim that Allah inspired the Quran. Even though
              my heart’s deepest desire was to defend the Islamic faith and remain
              Muslim, the truth became unavoidable: There was no argument I could
              use to defend Muhammad’s prophetic status, and there was no compel-
              ling reason to think the Quran was from God.
                  Once again, it was not just that history did not support the tradi-
              tional narratives of Islam, but rather that history proved to be entirely
              incompatible with Islamic origins. When using the same standards to
              assess the origins of Islam as are used to assess the origins of Christianity,
              we find a gaping hole in the historical record. The contemporary records
              of the mid-­seventh-­century Arabs, supposedly the very earliest Muslims
              after Muhammad’s time, show that they were not referred to as Muslims
              and that they never referred to their holy book, never mentioned
              Muhammad’s name, never referred to Mecca, and did not pray toward
              Mecca. Given the vast array of records from that time, especially those
              of the many nations conquered by Arabs, this is not an argument from
              silence. The contemporary historical record is simply incompatible with
              the traditional narrative of Islam.
                  Similarly, the history of the Quran is incompatible with the

                                                                                        289

           290    Is the Quran the Word of God?

           narrative we were taught as Muslims. We had been told that the Quran
           had never been changed, every letter remaining exactly the same from
           Muhammad’s time until today. On the contrary, the Quran had been
           fundamentally altered, being very fluid originally as an oral text and
           then evolving into a written text that remained in various degrees of
           flux even to this day.
               The traditional Islamic narratives of Muhammad and the Quran
           are fundamentally incompatible with the historical records. These are
           the pillars of Islamic confidence, and their foundations are ungrounded.
               This meant that if I wanted to remain Muslim, I would have to do so
           based on some reason other than objective truth. I could remain Muslim
           because I liked the Islamic message, because I desired the discipline of
           sharia, or because I just wanted to keep my family happy.
               But if there was one thing Islam had taught me, it was that I must
           submit to God and not to man. That meant following the truth, no
           matter where it led.
               Of course, the very reason I had been investigating the case for Islam
           was to respond to the case for Christianity. Now I had explored every
           recourse, and I had to be honest with myself and assess for the last time
           the case for Christianity and the case for Islam.


           THE EVIDENCE FOR CHRISTIANITY OVER ISLAM
           After thoroughly investigating the truth claims of Islam and Christianity,
           even while a Muslim, there was no avoiding the obvious truth: The
           evidence in favor of Christianity was far, far stronger than the evidence
           for Islam.
               The three core claims of Christianity, that Jesus died by crucifixion
           and rose from the dead proving he was God, are very firmly grounded
           in history. Even though Islam denies these points, I concluded that the
           historical evidence for Jesus’ death on the cross was as strong as any-
           thing historical could be, that his resurrection from the dead was by far
           the best explanation of the facts surrounding his crucifixion, and that
           his claiming to be God was the best way to account for the proclamation
           of the early church.

                                            Islam or Christianity? The Evidence Is Clear   291

                  These conclusions were not idiosyncratic but were based on the con-
              sensus of scholars across the theological spectrum.1 In other words, the
              truth of the Christian message makes the most sense of the historical
              evidence.
                  By contrast, neither of the core truth claims of Islam, that
              Muhammad is a prophet and that the Quran is the Word of God, are
              compelling. Muhammad’s character does not make one think he was
              a man chosen by God, nor was he prophesied in the Bible. He had no
              miraculous scientific insights either recorded in hadith or in the Quran.
              The Quran, for that matter, cannot be shown to be inspired by its lit-
              erary quality, by fulfilled prophecies, by mathematical patterns, or by
              miraculous preservation.
                  The traditional Islamic narrative is incompatible with both the his-
              tory of Christianity and even with its own historical records. To believe
              in the Islamic account of Christian origins while taking the historical
              records seriously, we would have to conclude that Jesus was an utterly
              incompetent Messiah and Allah is a deceptive God. The historical record
              of Islamic origins makes many scholars wonder whether Muhammad
              existed, and it makes scholars think the Quran was originally far more
              fluid and indeed a very different kind of book than it is today.
                  The Islamic narratives of Christian origins, and even of Islamic ori-
              gins, are incompatible with history. In other words, to believe the truth
              of Islam is to ignore the historical evidence.
                  As a Muslim, I wanted to base my beliefs not on blind faith, not on
              what appealed to me, and not even on my family’s heritage. I wanted
              to ground my faith in reality. If I wanted to take the records of history
              seriously, I had to abandon my Islamic faith and accept the gospel.
                  But that would come at a tremendous cost, essentially everything I
              had ever known. Is it worth sacrificing everything for the truth? Is the
              truth worth dying for?

                            IS THE TRUTH WORTH
                                 DYING FOR?




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 293                    7/1/16 1:57 PM

           L    eaving Islam can cost you everything: family, friends, job, every-
                thing you have ever known, and maybe even life itself. Is it really
           worth sacrificing everything for the truth? The answer is simple: It
           depends on the value of the truth.
               When we consider the gospel, we find the deep secrets of the world
           unfolded. We find a triune God because of whom love is eternal and
           absolute, who did not need the world but created it out of an overflow
           of his love. In him, Yahweh, we have the Father who loves us uncondi-
           tionally, who offers us extravagant grace, who runs to us when we turn
           to him, who makes us with a purpose and orchestrates all things for the
           good of those who love him. In Yahweh we find the Son who is willing
           to shoulder our pains, who leads us in exemplary humility by suffering
           for us, makes our burdens light, and forges a way for us to live life to
           the full even though we die. In Yahweh we receive the Holy Spirit, our
           Comforter, who fills us with grace, transforms our hearts, renews our
           minds, and sends us into the world as God’s hands and feet to serve
           others as he served us. The gospel is the answer to our individual pains,
           to the world’s sufferings, and to life’s mysteries.
               There is no God but one, and he is Father, Spirit, and Son. There is
           no God but one, and he is Jesus.
               It is worth all suffering to receive this truth and follow him. God is
           more beautiful than this life itself, and the one who loves him is ready to
           die when death comes, not just to glorify him but to hasten to his arms.
           Though we will die, we will live.
               Sara Fatima al-­Mutairi knew this when her brother locked her in her
           room. She knew that there was a great difference between the way of
           Muhammad and the way of the Messiah, and she was confident of the
           gospel’s truth. She chose not to repent for her faith in Christ.
               On August 12, 2008, a story in the Saudi newspaper Al-­Akhdood

           294




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 294                                                7/1/16 1:57 PM

                                                                          Conclusion   295

              appeared with this title: “A member of Al-­Hasba assassinates his sister
              over her conversion to Christianity.” The article shares these details: “A
              Saudi citizen working for the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue
              and the Prevention of Vice in the Eastern Province killed his sister for
              allegedly converting to the Christian religion. According to sources
              close to the victim, the murderer attacked the girl by burning her and
              cutting her tongue.”
                  Our sister, twenty-­six-­year-­old Sara Fatima, was certain of the grace
              of our God, that it was worth giving up everything to have him. She
              chose Jesus over this life.
                  It turns out, she did not spend her last minutes reconsidering her
              faith. Instead, her heart was overwhelmed with anguish for Muslims.
              In the final moments before her brother returned to take her life, she
              posted a poem online.1 Though he cut out her tongue and took her life,
              her living voice reaches us now. Here are the words that Sara Fatima left
              this world:

                       My tears are on my cheek and, Oh! the heart is sad.
                       On those who become Christians, how you are so cruel!
                       The Messiah says: “blessed are all the persecuted”
                       And we, for the sake of the Messiah bear all things.
                       What is it to you that we are apostates?
                       You will not enter our graves or be buried with us.
                       Enough, your swords do not matter to me at all!
                       Your threats do not concern me, and we are not afraid.
                       By God, I am to death a Christian!
                       O, my eye, cry for what has passed as a sad life,
                       For I was far from the Lord Jesus for many years.
                       O history, record! And bear witness, O witnesses!
                       We are Christians walking on the path of the Messiah.
                       Take from me this knowledge and note it well!
                       Jesus is my Lord, and he is the best protector.
                       I advise you to pity your state of being
                       Gaze upon your look of hatred, how hideous it is.
                       Man is brother of man, O learned ones!

           296    Conclusion

                    Where is the humanity and love? And where are you?
                    My last words I pray to the Lord of the worlds,
                    Jesus the Messiah, the Light of Clear Guidance:
                    Change their hearts and set right their discernment.
                    May he spread love among you, O Muslims.

               Amen, amen. To my sister, Sara Fatima, I say this: You were a
           Christian for mere months, yet your faith is an example to us all. May
           your voice echo forever, and may we follow your example as an inspi-
           ration, even unto death. We are confident we will be with you soon, in
           the arms of Jesus.

                                              NOTES

              Chapter 5: The Islamic Inquisition
                1. Along with Jesus’ deity and the Bible.

              Chapter 6: Comparing Tawhid and the Trinity
                1. We find out through verses like Philippians 2:10, where a reference to
                   Yahweh in Isaiah 45:23 is substituted with “Jesus,” that the name they
                   share is Yahweh.
                2. There is something to be said for this common Muslim response.
                   Christians excommunicated for heretical beliefs such as polytheism often
                   did relocate to areas like Arabia, so this hypothesis is not implausible.
                   However, I have found no actual evidence of such Christians living
                   specifically in Muhammad’s context.
                3. I do not use the word threat lightly, but the Arabic word for threat
                   surrounds the verse in question, in 50.14 and 50.20.
                4. Technically, Allahu-Akbar is in the comparative form, translating to
                   “God is greater.” For more, see question 14 in my book Answering Jihad:
                   A Better Way Forward (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2016).

                3. To be clear, I am not saying that echad necessitates a compound unity,
                   but it certainly allows for it. The word echad itself has many potential
                   meanings.

           Chapter 14: Comparing the Quran and the Bible
             1. Of course, the analogy breaks down when we consider that there are
                many copies of the Quran and only one incarnate Jesus, but this is
                perhaps the closest approximation to describing the symbolic impact of
                burning the Quran.
             2. Although a small number of scholars argue that portions were composed
                in orality, such as sections of Genesis and the book of Mark, this is
                strongly contested. And even if these portions were orally composed, the
                vast majority of the Bible was undoubtedly written.
             3. Cf. 16.101.
             4. I present here, of course, the Protestant position. There are more parallels
                between the Catholic and Muslim views of Scripture and authority.

           Chapter 18: Comparing the Traditions of the Founders
             1. “SAW” represents the common Muslim prayer recited whenever Muslims
                say the name of Muhammad: “May peace and blessings be upon him.”
                It is inserted here because my friend said the prayer immediately after
                saying Muhammad’s name.
             2. Sahih Bukhari, Book 84 (or 88, depending on the numbering system), is
                the Book of Apostates. In it are found hadith like, “Whoever changes his
                Islamic religion, kill him” (9.84.57).

                presentations of jihad, or those with Western audiences as the primary
                focus . . . Perhaps because early Muslim history is heavily emphasized in
                the Islamic educational curriculum, those who write in Arabic or other
                Muslim majority languages realize that it is pointless to present jihad as
                anything other than militant warfare.” David Cook, Understanding Jihad

              Chapter 19: Questioning Christian Peacefulness
                1. Notice the martial terms in which this word is used: “Repent therefore!
                   Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the
                   sword [rhomphaia] of my mouth” (Rev. 2:16 NIV). Also see Revelation 6:8.
                2. Luke 22:35–38 NIV: “Then Jesus asked them, ‘When I sent you without
                   purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?’ ‘Nothing,’ they answered.
                   He said to them, ‘But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag;
                   and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is written:
                   “And he was numbered with the transgressors”; and I tell you that this
                   must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its
                   fulfillment.’ The disciples said, ‘See, Lord, here are two swords.’ ‘That’s
                   enough!’ he replied.”
                3. The only potential challenge to this is the temple cleansing, so this
                   deserves some attention. All four gospels describe the event (Matt.
                   21:12–17; Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48; and John 2:13–17), but the
                   only account that appears violent is John’s. It describes Jesus seeing
                   cattle sellers, dove sellers, and moneylenders, and then making a whip
                   and driving out all from the temple. But a careful reading of the Greek
                   shows that Jesus expelled all three of these groups differently, none with
                   violence against people. First, he only struck the sheep and oxen: He
                   “drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle” (NIV). The
                   cattle having been driven out, their sellers followed. Jesus then turned
                   over the tables of the money changers, causing them to leave. Finally,
                   Jesus did not release the doves as this would amount to stealing them,
                   but he told their sellers in his zeal to depart. So Jesus systematically
                   purged the temple, having struck no man and not in a blind rage.

              Section: Question 2
                1. A Muslim might object, saying that “Jesus is Lord” might simply mean
                   “Jesus is a lord” or “Jesus is a prophet,” but the context of Romans
                   precludes this interpretation. Not only does such a reading usually
                   impose an anachronistic Islamic understanding of lordship and prophets
                   on the text, but also verse 13 clarifies which Lord is in mind. It quotes
                   Joel 2:32 NIV: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be




9780310522553_NoGodButOne_int_SC.indd 301                                                        7/1/16 1:57 PM

                saved,” where Lord is a rendering of the divine name, Yahweh. In its
                context, Romans 10:9 is saying Jesus is the Lord Yahweh, the God who
                saves. It is also insightful to remember that this is the exact meaning of
                the name “Jesus”: “God saves.”
             2. This is most clearly found in Matthew 12:39–40.
             3. An objection here may be that “Allah” refers to a generic concept of God,
                not a specific one, and the shahada just proclaims monotheism. This is a
                common rhetorical move, but the answer is apparent upon consideration:
                The message of Muhammad teaches specific doctrines about God (e.g.,
                he is not a Father, he is not a Son, he helped Muslims in the Battle of
                Badr, he chose Muhammad as a prophet, etc.). Together, the message of
                Muhammad forms a notion of God that is implicit in the word Allah.
                Therefore in the shahada, “Allah” refers to the God that Muhammad
                preached, the God of Islam.

             8. In fact, some scholars say that this teaching was formulated less than
                a year after Jesus’ death: “This tradition, we can be entirely confident,
                was formulated as tradition within months of Jesus’ death.” James D. G.

                9. It should be understood here, though, that the implications of
                   “converting” or becoming a Christian from a Jewish background at
                   this point in Christian history are not fully known, and the term
                   Christian when juxtaposed with Jew or even non-Christian is unavoidably
                   problematic. But terminology aside, the point stands: They were not
                   simply defending what they already believed.

               18. The only possible exception is found in Josephus’s autobiography. He tells
                   of seeing three personal acquaintances in the process of being crucified.
                   Being a friend of the soon-to-be emperor, he tearfully told Titus about
                   this. Titus “commanded immediately that they be taken down, and to
                   have the greatest care taken of them that they might recover.” Two of
                   the three died regardless, though one friend survived. That is the only
                   recorded account of anyone in Roman history surviving crucifixion:
                   a partial, interrupted crucifixion victim who was given an emperor’s
                   best medical treatment. There is no one on record to whom the full
                   punishment has been meted who has survived. Josephus, Life, 420–21.

                1. It is important to know, while reading this verse, that the early
                   Christians understood Jesus’ resurrection as being saved from death. See
                   Acts 2:31–32.

           Chapter 23: Assessing the Islamic Response
             1. I do not think an “objective observer” is ipso facto a naturalist. Naturalism
                is itself a conclusion that entails its own biases. I think an objective
                observer must allow for the existence of God without asserting it.
             2. I am not here arguing that this is a sufficient condition for concluding
                a miracle has occurred, but that it is a necessary condition. Many
                phenomena that are inexplicable for a time are later explained by
                additional knowledge. Further reason for believing a miracle has
                happened should be adduced. See chapter 25 for further discussion.

           Chapter 24: Conclusion
             1. This is true apart from the vindication of this message by the
                resurrection, of course—though the incredibility of the resurrection
                might compound the unappealing nature of the message in the eyes of
                some audiences, as well.

                4. Of course, what mattered was not the scholarly consensus so much as
                   the reason for the consensus: The evidence was so strong that virtually
                   everyone who studied the matters agreed.

                6. It is striking that Peter’s verbiage begins in a manner very similar to the
                   creed of 1 Corinthians 15:3–8.

                8. See 2 Corinthians 11:24–26 and Acts 14:19. The record of Paul’s
                   execution is found in 1 Clement 5, a few short years after his death. Paul’s
                   manner of execution is recorded in Eusebius’ Historia Ecclesiastica 2.25.5.
                9. The four are: Josephus, Hegesippus, Clement of Alexandria, and
                   Eusebius. Unfortunately, the accounts of Clement and Hegesippus are
                   only preserved in Eusebius’ Ecclesiastical History; the former in 2.1.3–5
                   as well as 2.23.3, the latter in 2.23.3–19. Eusebius’ account of Josephus
                   is found immediately following, 2.23.20–25, though there are some
                   discrepancies between his record and the record of our manuscripts of
                   Josephus, which records the account beginning in Antiquities 20.200.
               10. Since there is no narrative account of James seeing the risen Jesus, only
                   the report from 1 Corinthians 15, the reason for James’ conversion has
                   less scholarly consensus. Regardless, Habermas tells us that the majority
                   of critical scholars concede that James was converted as 1 Corinthians 15
                   reports, on account of a resurrection appearance. Habermas and Licona
                   list the following as examples of scholars who hold this view: Allison,
                   Betz, Byrskog, Conzelmann, Craig, Davis, Derret, Ehrman, Funk,
                   Hoover, Kee, Koester, Ladd, Lorenzen, Ludemann, Meier, Oden,

                1995). See also E. P. Sanders, Paul and Palestinian Judaism: A Comparison
                of Patterns of Religion (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1977).
             4. Thomas J. Herron has given strong arguments for dating 1 Clement
                before AD 70 in his book Clement and the Early Church of Rome: On
                the Dating of Clement’s First Epistle to the Corinthians, though others
                disagree and date it circa AD 90. Even the latter date is still within the
                lifetime of those who knew Paul, but the former date is nigh immediate
                by historical standards.

                Epistle to the Galatians (Exeter: Paternoster, 1982), 117.
             6. Galatians 2:12 NIV says “certain men came from James,” and some take
                this to mean that everything these men did was sanctioned by James,
                and by taking issue with them, Paul was taking issue with James himself.
                None of that is found in the text itself; there is no indication that James
                sanctioned their activities nor that Paul ever had an argument with James.
             7. It might be useful to also note that Antioch had about fifteen times the
                population of Jerusalem at this time in the first century, and a church
                schism here could have been dangerous. It was Paul’s duty to remind
                Peter of the disciples’ earlier decision.
             8. Acts 15:7–11 NIV says, “Peter got up and addressed them: ‘Brothers,
                you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the
                Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.

                   God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the
                   Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. He did not discriminate between
                   us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. Now then, why do you
                   try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we
                   nor our ancestors have been able to bear? No! We believe it is through the
                   grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.’”
                9. Some assume that Matthew 5:18 means the law will always apply. But
                   again, the Law here refers to the Pentateuch, and regardless, the verse
                   clearly says “until everything has been accomplished” (NIV), meaning
                   there will be an end, and there is good reason to think that the end is
                   the cross. Some point to verse 19 to say that people need to follow the
                   law to be saved, but that cannot be what Jesus means because the verse
                   explicitly says that even those who do set aside the commands and teach
                   others to do so will still be in the kingdom of heaven.
               10. Jews were required to take certain oaths as part of the ceremonial laws. By
                   telling His followers not to, Jesus was telling them to break Jewish law.
               11. An assumption that Stanley Porter challenges in his recent book, When
                   Paul Met Jesus: How an Idea Got Lost in History (New York: Cambridge
                   University Press, 2016).

               14. Of course, the epistle to the Romans is the exception that proves the
                   rule. It is the one Pauline letter sent to a congregation where Paul had not
                   been, and it is also the one letter that is most systematic and careful in
                   explicating its theology.
               15. Cf. Quran 61.14: “O ye who believe! Be Allah’s helpers, even as Jesus
                   son of Mary said unto the disciples: Who are my helpers for Allah?
                   They said: We are Allah’s helpers. And a party of the Children of Israel
                   believed, while a party disbelieved. Then We strengthened those who
                   believed against their foe, and they became the uppermost.”

                is the name of God in the book of Exodus . . . Jesus’ listeners know full
                well what he’s saying. They pick up stones to stone him because they
                think he’s committed a blasphemy, claiming himself to be God.” Bart
                Ehrman, “The Earliest Gospels” (lecture, “History of the Bible: The
                Making of the New Testament Canon,” the Great Courses).
             3. These are the exact words used to in the Greek Old Testament to address
                God in Psalm 35:23.
             4. For a more detailed treatment, see Richard J. Bauckham, “Monotheism
                and Christology in the Gospel of John” in Contours of Christology in
                the New Testament, ed. R. N. Longenecker (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans,
                2005), 148–66.
             5. Ehrman, “The Earliest Gospels.”
             6. The consensus dating for John is circa AD 90, though this date has been
                challenged because it relied on a scholarly assumption which is now
                defunct (i.e., John’s reliance upon the synoptics). Cf. J. A. T. Robinson,
                who dates the gospel of John between the fifties and sixties. See
                Robinson, Redating the New Testament (Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock,
                2000), 307. Regardless of its correctness, my reason for rejecting John
                was because it was written sixty years after Jesus’ death.
             7. Although the consensus dating for Mark is AD 65–70, this dating, like
                the consensus on John, relies upon obsolesced assumptions. Maurice
                Casey dates Mark near AD 40 in his work Aramaic Sources of Mark’s
                Gospel. For different reasons yet with a similar result, James Crossley has
                suggested in his monograph The Date of Mark’s Gospel that Mark was
                written sometime between the midthirties and midforties. I presently
                find a date in the early forties more compelling than any alternative,
                though my set of reasons are not exactly the same as either Casey or
                Crossley. With differing degrees of likelihood, it is possible that: Mark
                presupposed his hearers knew Pilate, Caiaphas, Bartimaeus, Rufus,
                and Alexander; that he did not want his hearers to know the identity of
                the boy fleeing naked and the apostle striking the high priest’s ear for
                purposes of protective anonymity; that his account predates the early
                church discussions about the law; that he was concerned about the
                impending statue of Caligula standing in the temple; that the gospel
                was spurred by Peter’s departure from Jerusalem; and that he wrote early
                enough to supply a standard text about Jesus’ ministry for those who had
                seen the risen Jesus themselves. Combined, these features would indicate
                a date around AD 40–44. Though that specific date is my position, it is
                consensus that Mark’s gospel is the first of the four.

                   Academic, 2007).
                9. The word used for “Lord” here is adonai, a word commonly used for
                   Yahweh but also applicable to humans. However, in context, this is the
                   Lord of the temple, which is Yahweh.
               10. Malachi 4:6 says God will “come and strike the land with total
                   destruction” (NIV). Of course, Christians understand the latter portion
                   of the prophecy to relate to Jesus’ second coming.
               11. Cf. Philo, On the Embassy to Gaius 368 and On Dreams 2.131.
               12. A charge we also find in John 10:33.
               13. The antecedent of the participles is Yahweh, and I have included the
                   antecedent in my translation as “he.”
               14. Deuteronomy 33:26; Psalm 104:3, Isaiah 19:1.
               15. It should be remembered that this is not the first time in the Old
                   Testament that Yahweh is depicted as two persons, or as being in two
                   separate places. See chapter 6.
               16. The potential exception is the Exagoge of Ezekiel, a Hellenistic Jewish
                   drama in which Moses has a vision of a throne on Mt. Sinai, where a
                   noble man sitting on the throne gestures to Moses with his right hand
                   that Moses take his place on the throne, giving Moses his crown and
                   scepter with his left hand. The noble man could be God, and Moses
                   might actually sit on the throne, though neither is said explicitly.

               19. As stated in a previous note, I prefer a date for Mark in the early forties,
                   and therefore I am not one of those who believe Paul writes earlier than
                   Mark. But I am in the great minority.

           Chapter 31: Assessing the Islamic Response
             1. Or at least a theology of multiple persons within one Godhead.
             2. A few verses later, Jesus cleansed a leper in his own authority, a miracle
                that no prophet from the Old Testament had ever done and one which
                could give away his identity. So “Jesus sent him away at once with a
                strong warning: ‘See that you don’t tell this to anyone’” (Mark 1:43–44
                NIV).
             3. John 7:30.
             4. Parallels in Matthew 16:16–20 and Luke 9:21.
             5. Mark 8:30 and 9:41 imply that Jesus is the Messiah, but neither verse
                shows explicit admission, the kind that Muslims often seek for a
                claim to deity. In addition, both are private conversations, not public
                proclamations. Matthew 16:16–20 is the exception that proves the rule;
                here, in private, Jesus admits that he is the Christ, but insists that he
                himself did not tell them this, nor does he want them to tell anyone.
                (Parallel in Luke 9:21 without clear admission.) The same can be said of
                John’s gospel; the clearest admission is John 4:26, when he agrees that he
                is the Messiah, but it is a private conversation. Publicly, many continue
                to be upset that he has not clearly said who he is (see John 10:24). Also,
                if John 4:26 suffices as a claim to be the Messiah, so should John 20:29
                suffice to be a claim to deity.
             6. There is textual contention as to the original form of the verse.
             7. The title is used in didactic, apocalyptic, and historical settings.
             8. The criterion of dissimilarity suggests that a historical datum must be
                sufficiently dissimilar from its context if we are to be certain that it was
                not imposed onto history. In the case at hand, Jews were not expecting
                the Messiah to be the Son of Man, so we would not expect such a claim
                to be imposed upon Jesus; perhaps more important, the early church
                virtually abandons the title, thus making it unlikely that the gospel
                authors would have retroactively projected the words onto Jesus. The
                only likely reason that they portray Jesus using this title so regularly is
                because he actually did use it for himself.

                   2.19.177, in which Muhammad recites Sura Najm, causing jinn and
                   pagans to prostrate with him. This is part of a much larger account,

                arguing that Muhammad actually did proclaim the satanic verses.

                behind the Messenger of Allah who was riding a donkey while the sun
                was setting. He asked: Do you know where this sets? I replied: Allah and

                to Muhammad, since Ibn Hisham had already discussed excising

                   her with his hand because he was blind, and separated the child from
                   her. He thrust his sword in her chest till it pierced up to her back. Then

                9. Some may respond by objecting that Ahmad is a title for Muhammad,
                   but that is begging the question.

                   level, engaging read, consider Tom Holland’s In the Shadow of the Sword:

                   the traditional anxiety regarding translation. If the Koran is not
                   comprehensible—if it can’t even be understood in Arabic—then it’s not
                   translatable. People fear that.”
                3. This is disputed on grounds of subjectivity, but that serves to further
                   exemplify the matter at hand: Who is to say whether something is
                   actually the best?
                4. An astute observer might deduce that I have not watched major league
                   basketball since the mid-1990s. He would be correct.

             5. A Muslim might object that Muhammad did not abrogate the Quranic
                verses so arbitrarily, but that is begging the question. Unless we have good
                reason to think that he was a prophet, he may very well have done so. That
                would not necessitate a subversive character; he could have had the best of
                intentions while abrogating a text such as this hypothetical example.
             6. We will consider this phenomenon explicitly in the upcoming chapter.
             7. Quran 7.12; 15.27; 38.76; 55:15. As a reminder, I do not consider such
                apparent “contradictions” problematic, either in the Quran or in the
                Bible. Please see chapter 15.

            10. Ibid.
            11. Philips continues: “It may be further concluded that the Doctor’s record
                of data falsification, textual changes and figure manipulation clearly
                indicate his dishonesty as a researcher and expose the low levels to which
                he stooped to invent support for his hoax. Hence, nineteen and its
                multiples may not be used to interpret anything of the Qur’an or Islam
                and all those sincere Muslims who have publicly propagated this theory
                in ignorance are Islamically obliged to publicly disown and discredit it,
                and immediately cease the publication, distribution and sale of books
                and tapes which support it.”
            12. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.510.
            13. Some Muslims argue here that the variants were only in the vocalization
                of the Quran, but the vocalizations were not yet recorded in the text.
                In other words, there would be no reason to destroy the manuscripts
                because of variant vocalizations. The differences must have been in the
                rasm, the consonantal text itself.
            14. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.509.
            15. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.511.
            16. In response, some Muslims argue that he had the only written evidence
                to support what Zaid and others had memorized, but the hadith and
                earliest Islamic sources simply do not say that. They say only one man
                had these two verses.
            17. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.510. Some argue that Zaid would not have known to
                search for it had he not had it memorized, and therefore Khuzaima must
                have had a written record. That is not what the hadith says, though,
                and it could just as easily be that Zaid had a vague recollection of it and
                needed to find someone who was much more familiar with it.

               18. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.550.
               19. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.558. I have removed the words “such and such” from
                   the translation to make the hadith more readable.
               20. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.527.
               21. Some would try to argue that the verse had been abrogated, unbeknownst
                   to Ubay, but that actually proves the ultimate point of this section: The
                   Quran was a fluid composition, and to say it has been perfectly preserved
                   takes faith, not an objective assessment of the evidence.
               22. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.521.
               23. For example, Sahih Bukhari 6.61.512 indicates that a blind man was
                   able to influence a verse of the Quran after it had been revealed, having
                   an exception added to the text. These sorts of phenomena are also
                   disconcerting to those who are not already Muslim.

              Chapter 39: Assessing the Response
                1. Any reference to an Arabic kitab, the word for “book,” was actually an
                   oral text that was handed down through poets and reciters. It was not a
                   written book.
                2. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.513.
                3. This is exactly what 2.106 and 16.101 say: Allah can “cause people to
                   forget.”
                4. There are many records of this, perhaps the best being one that was
                   recently rediscovered: Kitab al-Masahif by ibn Abi Daud. One can also
                   refer to Ibn Nadim’s Fihrist and Suyuti’s Itqan fi Ulum al-Quran.
                5. Ibn Abbas and Abu Musa. See Suyuti’s Itqan fi Ulum al-Quran.
                6. Sahih Bukhari 6.61.521
                7. The details are also found in the sources quoted above: Kitab al-Masahif,
                   Fihrist, and Itqan fi Ulum al-Quran.

              Conclusion to Question 2
                1. To clarify, non-Christian scholars do not believe Jesus rose from
                   the dead, but they concede the facts that are best explained by His
                   resurrection; similarly, scholars do not all concede that Jesus claimed
                   to be God, but the current consensus is that the earliest Christians did
                   believe Jesus to be divine, which I only take one step further by saying
                   that the best explanation for this is that Jesus claimed to be divine.

           Section: Conclusion
             1. The details of Sara Fatima’s final moments differ from account to
                account, as people can only piece together her story from her online posts
                and the news reports. My understanding is that, in the days leading up
                to her martyrdom, she was working on a poem that was a response to a
                Muslim who was cursing apostates. She finished that poem in her last
                moments in light of her impending sacrifice.

           Answering Jihad
           A Better Way Forward
           Nabeel Qureshi, Author of
           The New York Times Bestseller,
           Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus

           From New York Times bestselling author
           and former Muslim Nabeel Qureshi
           comes this personal, challenging, and respectful answer to the
           many questions surrounding jihad, the rise of ISIS, and Islamic
           terrorism.
              San Bernardino was the most lethal terror attack on
           American soil since 9/11, and it came on the heels of a coor-
           dinated assault on Paris. There is no question that innocents
           were slaughtered in the name of Allah and in the way of jihad,
           but do the terrorists’ actions actually reflect the religion of
           Islam? The answer to this question is more pressing than ever,
           as waves of Muslim refugees arrive in the West seeking shel-
           ter from the violent ideology of ISIS.
              Setting aside speculations and competing voices, what
           really is jihad? How are we to understand jihad in relation
           to our Muslim neighbors and friends? Why is there such a
           surge of Islamist terrorism in the world today, and how are
           we to respond?
              In Answering Jihad, bestselling author Nabeel Qureshi
           (Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus) answers these questions from
           the perspective of a former Muslim who is deeply concerned
           for both his Muslim family and his American homeland.
